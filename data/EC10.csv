Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Zoe's Kitchen Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the lines will be open for your questions following the presentation. Please note that this conference is being recorded today, August 27, 2015.
On the call today, we have Kevin Miles, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Besch, Principal Financial Officer.
Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Jim Besch. Please go ahead.
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
Thank you, operator, and good afternoon. By now, everyone should have access to our second quarter 2015 earnings release. If not, it can be found at www.zoeskitchen.com in the Investor Relations section.
Before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussions today will include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and, therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These statements are also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. We refer all of you to our recent SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition.
Also during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and a reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures is available in our earnings release.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Miles.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to report our second quarter results that demonstrated a continuation of the strong operating momentum we've had this year. Highlights for the 12-week period ending July 13, 2015, include revenue growth of over 30%, comparable restaurant sales growth of 5.6%, marking our 22nd consecutive quarter of positive comparable restaurant sales growth driven once again by increases in traffic, mix, average check, and adjusted EBITDA growth of over 28%. Seven new company-owned restaurants opened during this quarter.
We believe that the strength and the consistency of our results continue to demonstrate the distinctive positioning of our brand. At Zoe's Kitchen, our mission is to deliver goodness with fresh better-for-you options served with genuine Southern hospitality. It's our unwavering commitment to this mission that we view as one of our most important and unique differentiators and one that we think continues to build a strong emotional connection to our guests.
One of my favorite things to talk about is our team. Quarter two marks our 20th anniversary and we recognize the milestone with 20 years of goodness celebration companywide. Throughout this summer we have team members to nominate colleagues and guests that embody our mission of delivering goodness and the values of living Zoe's. Hundreds of team members were nominated and each of these team members will be recognized – have a special recognition for the impact that they make on our brand.
One of the comment that stood out to me was about Aldo, a kitchen leader in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Aldo lives Zoe's every single day. He goes above and beyond in every opportunity possible. Aldo is truly happy when he is helping others. You can hear him chatting with guests from the kitchen while they're ordering. I tell the team frequently that living Zoe's is more than just words, it's your desire to put others first and individually share your talents. Aldo is one of many who are contributing to this exceptional culture. The ongoing investment in our team also includes regular evaluations of systems and practices in order to us – o further optimize our operation which in turn improves the guest experience.
We've been testing a new KDS system as a way to gain more insight to this speed of service. This is particularly important as we continue to grow our average unit volumes. We've been very pleased with the early result of the tests, which is currently in four locations. All of our system improvements have the same objective, an exceptional guest experience where we can showcase our differentiated menu of freshly prepared Mediterranean-inspired dishes served with Southern hospitality.
On the development front, we opened seven new company-owned Zoe's Kitchen restaurants bringing our year-to-date development at the end of second quarter to 151. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we've opened an additional seven restaurants bringing our total number of restaurants to 158. We remain pleased with the performance of our newer units including the early results of our 2015 class of restaurants which bolsters our confidence in our hub-and-spoke strategy and a wide acceptance of our brand.
We continue to expect to open 31 to 33 new company-owned restaurants this year and have leases signed for the balance of 2015 development. In addition, we have approximately 75% of our leases signed for 2015 pipeline, which includes the newest hub in Denver, Colorado. We currently have three leases signed in Denver. We will continue to identify new opportunities as we have previously stated. This strategy will build awareness in the first 12 to 18 months in this new hub market. We remained confident that we will continue to successfully operate more than 1600 domestic restaurants over the long term.
I would like to turn the call over to Jim for detailed discussions of our second quarter financial results.
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
Thanks, Kevin.
For the 12-week period ended July 13, 2015, total revenue increased 30.0% to $54.5 million from $41.9 million in the second quarter last year. Company-owned restaurant sales increased 30.3% to $54.4 million compared to $41.8 million in the year-ago period. The increase in restaurant sales was largely due to the addition of 29 new company-owned restaurants since the second quarter of last year combined with the acquisition of three franchise restaurants in November of 2014.
As Kevin noted, comparable restaurant sales increased 5.6% during the second quarter. The increase consisted of a 1.3% increase in traffic, a 3.5% increase in mix, and a 0.8% increase in price. As a reminder, restaurants enter our comparable base after they are open for 18 periods. Our comparable base consisted of 105 restaurants at the end of our second quarter.
Turning now to expenses. For the second quarter, cost of goods sold as a percentage of restaurant sales, was 31.8%. While we continue to see year-over-year improvement in cost of sales as a result of new annual pricing agreements for feta cheese, olive oil, and produce, we did see a sequential uptick in costs resulting from increases in chicken and produce partially offset by lower paper product costs.
Looking ahead, poultry prices remained elevated compared to last year, and we have several produce items currently under Act of God pricing, specifically onions, bell peppers, cucumbers zucchini, and cherry tomatoes. As a result, we currently anticipate third quarter cost of sales of 32.2% and slightly under 32% for the full year.
Labor cost as a percentage of restaurant sales increased 40 basis points year-over-year to 27.6%. As we discussed last quarter, the increase was driven by an increase in the number of training stores, and ongoing costs associated with developing our management bench to support future growth. These increases were partially offset by leverage on comparable store sales growth.
Store operating expenses rose to 19.3% of restaurant sales during the second quarter, an increase of 180 basis points compared to the prior-year period. Store operating expenses included approximately $230,000 of restaurant-level expenses related to our annual general managers conference, which was held in the second quarter of 2015 as opposed to the first quarter in 2014. Excluding this timing difference store, operating expense margin increased 140 basis points compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by the normalization of repair and maintenance costs compared to the prior year as we did not incur a full quarter of preventative maintenance as a result of escalating issues with our former maintenance vendor. We also experienced higher occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales compared to prior year. Overall, in the second quarter, restaurant contribution increased 31.2% to $11.6 million from $8.8 million last year. Restaurant contribution margin as a percentage of restaurant sales, improved approximately 10 basis points year-over-year to 21.3%.
General and administrative costs increased by $1.8 million to $6.3 million in the second quarter of 2015, up from $4.5 million in the prior-year quarter. G&A expenses in the quarter included approximately $550,000 related to executive transition costs, approximately $180,000 related to the timing of our 2015 GM Conference as discussed previously, and approximately $100,000 related to the breakage of the lease at our Riverside location in Jacksonville, Florida, in conjunction with the relocation of the restaurant. Excluding these unusual items, in addition to $142,000 of certain IPO-related expenses in the second quarter of last year, G&A as a percent of total revenues decreased approximately 40 basis points in the prior-year quarter.
Looking forward with regard to G&A, at the end of our second quarter our public float held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million, and as a result we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. In addition to changes in certain accounting and reporting requirements, we will now be required by the SEC to be SOX compliant as a large accelerated filer by the year-end 2015. While we have been ahead of schedule in preparing for many of these requirements, the performance of our stock as of July 13, 2015, has resulted in an acceleration of certain procedures that were not planned for at the beginning of the year. As a result, we expect to incur approximately $500,000 of incremental costs associated with our integrated audit requirement and other professional services, as well as additional head count.
Pre-opening cost increased to $637,000 from $442,000 in the second quarter of 2014, due primarily to the timing of the unit openings. Looking ahead, we expect the 31 to 33 openings for 2015 to result in pre-opening costs of approximately $2.7 million for the full year including approximately $800,000 in the third quarter.
Interest expense was approximately $710,000 compared to $620,000 in the second quarter of 2014. Our reported interest expense currently represents noncash expenses related to our deemed landlord financing. For the remaining quarters, we believe that our second quarter expense should provide a useful guide for modeling approximately $750,000 per quarter.
Provision for income taxes was $871,000 in the second quarter, as compared to a benefit of $124,000 in the year-ago period. Our annual tax provision is derived from the book-to-tax difference created by our goodwill intangible. The annual provision for taxes is spread quarterly based on the pre-tax income loss and the forecasted pre-tax income loss for the full year.
Net income for the quarter was $120,000 or $0.01 per share, as compared to a $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2014 or $0.06 per share. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $19.6 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared with $19.5 million in the year-ago period.
To account for the impact of our April 2014 IPO and the resulting change to our capital structure as well as other one-time adjustments, we've calculated adjusted net income. Our adjusted results reflect our post-IPO capital structure, including our basic and diluted share count as if the IPO occurred prior to the beginning of 2014. Attached to our press release, you'll find a reconciliation of our GAAP results to our adjusted financial results. We believe that the adjusted results provide a useful view of our business given our current capital structure and post-IPO cost structure.
Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2015 was $955,000 or $0.05 per share versus $705,000 or $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2014.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Jim.
Before I close, I'd like to provide our updated outlook for 2015. We currently expect restaurant sales between $220 million and $224 million and royalty fees to be approximately $200,000. We expect comparable restaurant sales growth of 5% to 6%. Keep in mind that we lapped last year's approximately 1.3% price increase in July and we currently don't intend to take price for the remainder of 2015.
Our restaurant contribution margin is expected to range between 20.0% and 20.5%. We plan on opening 31 to 33 company-owned restaurants during the year. And finally, we expect G&A expenses to be between $25.3 million and $25.5 million, excluding executive transition cost.
With that, we take great pride in delivering goodness to our team and our guests by embodying the four pillars of the Mediterranean lifestyle: eat, cook, live, and connect Mediterranean. We continue to inspire our guests to focus on the value of the food they consume, enjoy the experiences with family and friends, and feel benefits associated with choosing meals that fuel an active and healthy lifestyle, allowing them to live life to the fullest.
We remain excited about our plan to bring wholesome, freshly prepared Mediterranean dishes to guests across the country and are committed to capitalizing on the large opportunity we see ahead to grow and strengthen our brand, ultimately rewarding our shareholders over the long term.
Before we take questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank each Zoe's team member. I mean it when I say that each of you who continue to deliver goodness to your colleagues and our guests that are building our business and our brand. When you come to work each day you're not only helping people live Mediterranean; you're building a team that's empowered to make a difference. Together, we've grown Zoe's Kitchen into a brand I'm truly honored to be a part of, and I'll see you in a restaurant soon.
Thanks, everyone, for your interest in our company. And now we're happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, you can open the line.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Karen Short from Deutsche Bank.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey thanks for taking my question. I guess just a little clarification. Your top-line guidance was raised. Your contribution margin was a little better than expected in the second quarter. So I guess I'm just curious why not raise the restaurant contribution margin for the full year given the beat and strong margins. Are you just staying conservative, or anything to point to there?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hi, Karen. This is Kevin. Yeah, I think – and Jimmy can jump in. But we still – just to kind of point you back, the back half of our year kind of being the holidays, and going into Q3-Q4, kind of slows and ramps downward in the back half of the year. We do have some openings, and that as well contribute into that kind of dip – a little bit of our margin there.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then I guess just curious if you could give a little color on the cadence of the comp in the quarter, and I guess if there was any weather impact on the comp. Obviously, you were asked about that in the first quarter because there had been some bad weather into the very early part of the second quarter.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, the cadence, really, it really wasn't any difference throughout the quarter. We did see little a weather as everybody is aware of in Texas, which is our biggest market. But really, the cadence was throughout each of the three periods kind of equally the same.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And any color on how much the weather might have impacted the comps?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We never have really identified weather. It did impact our patio business and some people trying to get out of cars not wanting to get wet, but we did equate any impact of that. But you could assume there is some slight impact to that weather outlook, kind of the first part of Q2.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just the last question I had, in your prepared remarks you actually – I think you said that poultry was a headwind for you in this quarter, but in your Q you actually called it out as a tailwind. I just wanted to clarify that I heard that right.
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
Yeah. I'm sorry. Can you actually repeat that?
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Well, I think in your prepared remarks, as it related to COGS, you called out poultry as a headwind for you in the quarter, but in your Q I think you actually called it out as a benefit.
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
So, in the year-over-year quarter, it is a benefit. But when we were looking at sequential from last quarter to this quarter, there was a slight uptick. With that being said, I think we're anticipating for it to remain fairly flat here in the third quarter and hoping to see some decrease at the end of the year.
Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question from Andy Barish from Jefferies.
Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Just wondering on some of the same-store sales composition. I know mix looked like it really kind of continued to pick up and be a big driver in the 2Q. Is there anything specific going on that you can point to other than some of the new menu items you rolled out at the beginning of the year?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Andy, this is Kevin. Yeah, now – the biggest driver in the quarter, really – back to mix, just to kind of point everybody back on the mix, much of that mix is the catering traffic that goes through that, as we count a catering customer equal to a dine-in customer. So some of that mix is all driven predominantly by catering. That said, we've really seen the Hummus Trio and the two new hummuses as well as the Med Chicken Dinner drive some impact, which is a lot of where you'll see coming from in the price area. It is kind of significantly where you're seeing that, because the uptick both of those items are at a higher price point.
Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC
And I guess is this seasonally a stronger catering business in the 2Q? Just kind of wondering if there is a little more color on that.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Not really. It's a relatively flat. Kind of it ramps up. It has the first part of Q1. It kind of goes equally through until the back part of Q3, and then kind of declines going into the holidays.
Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then just finally, you had – back on the cost of goods, you had negative 4% basket in the 1Q. Jim, do you have the 2Q number off the top of your head?
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
We don't have that comparison going into Q2.
Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.
Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you just talk a little bit about your – more about your speed of service initiative? And how are you comping at peak meal periods around lunch and dinner and how might that impact that? Thanks.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. Hey, Nicole. This is Kevin. You know we're still early stages. We're, I guess, now three months or so into our two – three or four stores that we've rolled out. We're analyzing that data right now.
We believe, again, long-term, that it is absolutely a throughput enhancer for us. Don't have enough data to share with you at this point, but all signs and tests point to very positive results, especially just in the kind of culture side of the business, the team building on the ability to have an ease of use and be able to focus just directly on what they need to focus on. So from that standpoint, the test is going really well, but no data to give you as far as how much it is increasing throughput or anything at this point. And we still have intent for a 2016-type rollout unless we have any major glitches along the way.
And then, I'm sorry, the back half of the year – you said lunch and dinner. At this point, we're seeing comp through lunch – it's kind of really all dayparts – just to kind of break it down, catering in growing the comp about a third, lunch a third, dinner a third, is really what we're seeing. So as far as what does KDS do for that, again, don't have enough insight to that. Today, I do think the biggest enhancer will be at lunch time from a throughput standpoint.
Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Thank you. And a last quick one if I may. Your development has been absolutely on target on time, if not even a little bit faster. Does that give you more confidence, obviously, about hitting 4Q openings and being at the higher end or even the ability to look out into next year and be signing and looking at developments? How does that give you incremental confidence?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We're very confident. The development team has done an outstanding job. We've gone across the country. We're really excited about going into Denver. It'll be our first market that we've got several leases signed in quickly. Kansas City opened extremely well. So, it was approximately 75% of our 2016 pipeline baked already. I feel very, very confident going into 2016 that we can see some openings get opened in the first part of the year. It'd be really strong opening for us.
Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Thanks again.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from William Slabaugh from Stephens.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, guys. Kevin, you mentioned the 2015 stores opening up well, and from the previous question kind of touching on the overall kind of positive signs you've seen in the previous classes. So I'm just curious if you had any commentary around is the 2013 class and the 2014 class also shaping up as you would have hoped they would be shaping up at this point? And is there any geographical differences you can point to as you go into some of these new markets like Kansas City or some of the more northeastern markets as well?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. We're, again, still very, very excited about Kansas City. It's continued to perform like our model – we expected our model to in a new market. As far as the class of 2013-2014, we really haven't spelled all those out. We talked about the vintage stores continuing to comp at very nice pace. But the 2013-2014 class, although they came out of the ground stronger than our model, you can expect them probably to comp a little bit slightly less, but still comping very well, and at or above our kind of guidance that we've comped and we've spoken of in the past of a comp.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.
Got it, got it. And then a quick update if you had one on the commodity basket inflation or deflation you might anticipate seeing in the back half. I know you gave the cost of sales guidance for 3Q, but curious if you have any thoughts beyond that into 4Q or what 2016 could potentially look like as you start looking at what you may lock in or may not for next year.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, so what we're – again we've talked about kind of that slightly below 32% for the full year. We continue to see chicken kind of bounce around a little bit. As we've mentioned to you in the past, it never seems to follow what (25:49) report says it's going to do.
But nonetheless, we've seen some decline or even seen some flattening of the tenders to slightly decline, but mostly flat, so still some escalation in the breast market, in the whole chicken market. What we understand at this point is that will still continue to be at the higher point, but coming down potentially in the back half of the year, with the caveat of reverse migration in Avian flu, any kind of scares that may come from that.
Everything else in the basket, though, seems to be relatively stable other than what Jim mentioned on the act of God. So we still have some risk there specifically in things like onions and peppers and cucumbers. It's pretty significant to our overall produce basket when all three of them are an act of God. Sort of first year, we've actually seen kind of all three kind of come in and play at the same time. So, again, I'd point you back, I believe that COGS will come down and be flat to last year and slightly under the 32%, but I think Q3 is still going to be a little high. In Q4 we should start to see some relief.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. That's helpful. One quick follow-up if I could on the labor front. You'd mentioned previously you planned on spending just a little more in some areas on labor, a third GM and some bigger-volume storage potentially. So I'm curious on kind of the updated thoughts there.
And then separately, you mentioned you didn't expect to take any more price for the year, that maybe more commodity-driven. But I'm curious if you would consider maybe into 2016 taking more price if you were to see wage inflation or overall labor cost inflation continue to rise in a more structural basis.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I think it's kind of the way we looked at this year is exactly what you said on the commodity side. We've been able to see some significant savings there as we've negotiated our contracts and continue to negotiate. So that's the main reason there. If we were to see whether it be commodity or labor pressures, we would consider taking price. I think kind of the way we look at it is we do research every year at the beginning of the year, and we're really four weeks away from taking price at any given point in time.
So if we needed to do it even in the back half of this year, we could do that. Our intent is not to do that, though. In 2016 again we will reevaluate that. We will have some menu introduction in 2016 as well, so some price kind of comes through a new menu innovation. So we would definitely consider price as we do every year.
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
And just to add on to your initial question about training stores or three-GM stores, at the end of the second quarter, we had 19 stores that were currently staffed with three GMs. At that same point in the prior year, we only had 9. So I think we continue to anticipate that to be a higher year-over-year cost, and as we continue to add restaurants we'll continue to grow that number.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thanks, guys.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason West from Credit Suisse.
Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah. Thanks, guys. Can you hear me okay?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
Hey, Jason.
Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. Just couple on G&A. The guidance there that went up, does that include the $550,000 item in the quarter? And also where were you on stock comp within the G&A now?
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
Yeah. So the $25.3 million and $25.5 million is excluding the transition costs that occurred in the second quarter. And I think previously we had guided stock comp to $1.3 million for the year, and we still feel that's a reasonable estimate.
Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. And then, on G&A the expenses for the Sarb-Ox compliance, does any of that roll off next year, or is this all sort of run rate expenses that you're going to hold on to going forward?
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
Yeah. So, the reality the majority of those expenses that we're estimating, a lot of that is going to be recurring costs going forward. Kind of the primary pieces of that really are associated with audit requirements, whether external audit or – as well as the fact that we're outsourcing our internal audit function, which is going to take on a even more critical role next year. So we believe the majority of that will carry forward.
That being said, there is a hope that we'll be able to leverage components of that. We hope to gain some additional efficiencies in the audit process. And whatever head count we really bring on, we obviously hope to leverage that to help in other areas.
Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Got it. Helpful. And then one other one on the cost in the new stores. Kevin, I believe you said we can expect the 2013 and 2014 stores to comp slightly less. And I'm not sure if you're saying in terms of them opening at higher volumes so there's just less room to grow into, or are you're saying those stores are comping below the base, if you could kind of clarify what that means?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that. No, I mean they've opening up – they opened up at a stronger volume – a stronger opening volume. So, thus, instead of comping in that first year maybe kind of the 8 to 10 range, they comp in that 6 to 8 range instead, but they're opening up at a much higher volume.
Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Got it. Thank you.

. Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair & Co.
Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Kevin, can you talk about – I think you were testing some new ovens, what you're seeing with that technology. And then secondarily, any thoughts on small-order delivery?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Sharon. Yeah. So we still continue to test. We've actually expanded that test into, I believe, four more locations, five more locations. And one piece of equipment, specifically, and that's around the combination oven – the combi oven, that is absolutely working fantastic for us at this point. We have a good – a backfill strategy going. We want to get into a larger test to make sure it did work in all these locations. But it continues to allow some bigger batch cooking, enhancing our catering abilities in some of those markets as well as throughput and prep there. So that piece of equipment is doing very well.
We tested two – three other pieces of equipment that were more of that cook-to-order pieces of equipment. We have found one did not work. We've got two others now in test. And we're working the recipes. We feel good about one of them, but have not moved forward with any additional stores at this point. But I do think you'll see some technology with Antonio coming on board, really enhancing the ability to enhance those menu items in those pieces of equipment.
And as far as small orders, we have been in talks with a few – very, very discovery kind of conversions with some of the delivery services out there. They're doing the small order. Nothing to speak of yet, but we are exploring it at this point in time.
Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi, good afternoon. Kevin, I just wanted to maybe ask about the same-store traffic trends being up just about 1% in the quarter. How do you think about that kind of growth, and what is your overall expectations for the businesses as you look forward, not only in the second half of this year but longer term in terms of your ability to grow the traffic number?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. We continue to think it's going to be very positive. And I know I keep beating the dead horse here, but so much of our traffic is dumped into mix. So we kind of look at it together when we look at roughly the 3.5% of mix and the 1.3% of traffic. So it's very organic, again pointing back to very little marketing spend driving this. So it's really that brand awareness and everything that's going. So we expect it to remain positive and continue kind of on those same trends throughout the back half of the year and even going into next year. I think you could even – hopefully, we'll see some acceleration again as we continue to penetrate and build some of the smaller markets with more locations. Dallas is our biggest, and we've seen that now since 2009 continue where traffic and mix continued to grow.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess a follow-up question on SG&A. I know that you're still at a very small scale today and there is a lot of investments needed as you scale up the business. But how do you think about that line as you look into maybe next year or the following couple of years, and your ability to leverage that. Do you think that the level of investment growth will start to slow and we'll start to see leverage on that or do you it will be more modest leverage as you scale up?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I think again it's – we're very excited to be SOX compliant. We're happy that we're in the big league now with the other folks. It was a little quick, so that acceleration that you're seeing this year obviously will continue on as we go forward. So there will be a little bit there that was unanticipated. As soon as it was, we anticipate it to be there but not as soon as we are. So with that, we'll continue to invest there.
So you probably won't see – I think we've always pointed 2015, no acceleration, and maybe slight 2016 is what we said. I don't know now as we continue to build everything around SOX and our requirements if we will see as much in 2016. But I do believe after 2016 – maybe slightly in 2016, you'll start to see that grow through 2017 and out at a nice pace. And kind of the way we originally had modeled it out as is if you kind of take 75% of the revenue growth and model that in, that's kind of how we've looked at the leverage over time. But probably seeing that more in 2017.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great, that's helpful. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Westra from Stifel.
Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great, thanks. Good afternoon.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Paul.
Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
My first question is on a little bit more color on the operating expense line. I know you mentioned it was up 140 basis points year-over-year if you exclude the impact of the manager meeting. It still seems – a little more color other than higher occupancy expense could maybe help out. And the 2Q number, even adjusted, was higher than the 1Q number, which hasn't been the case in the past. So just trying to get a feel where that number is heading and maybe some commentary on the second half whether you expect that line to be levered or maybe see some deleverage?
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
Yeah, thanks, Paul, this is Jim. A lot of the store operating expense line comes down to really the comparison year-over-year. Last year, we had bit more volatility as we mentioned due to issues with our maintenance provider. What that resulted in was some inconsistencies from quarter-to-quarter primarily in the repair and maintenance line. In the current year, with service channel in place, it's giving us much more insight into our expense, helping us really monitor the expense. But what we're seeing this year is a very normalized flattened-out expense as opposed to some of the up-and-down spikes that we saw in the previous years.
So I think what you'll see for the remainder of this year is a much more normalized line on that operating expense, especially R&M, and it's going to lead to much more, much better comp for next year.
Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thanks. I recall last year – this was in the third quarter – had some actual – some spiking higher expenses in that line. Was that...
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
That's exactly right. In the third quarter we did see some of the uptick back up in the R&M. So, obviously, there's a hope that we'll be much a closer percentage next year. But on that same token, in the fourth quarter of last year, we saw the R&M tick back down. So like I said, there was just a lot of inconsistencies in the prior-year number, and I think what we'll see is a nice flatter line this year and going forward.
Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. A question on development. You have seven already opened this – so far in the quarter. Should we expect any more for the third quarter, new units as far as modeling?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, we have a couple of more coming into – roughly three to four coming into Q3 that we'll finish up, and then we'll finish the rest in Q4.
Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. And then looking out to next year's development, still looking for maybe 25% of total development being in new markets. And would you qualify just Denver and KC to make up those roughly eight stores in new market that was (39:17).
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's correct. I think those would be the two markets that you'll see that new development. And as we talked, it was up to 25%. In 2015, the only new store that will be opened in the new market is the Kansas City store, so you can assume that the rest of the stores were all in existing markets. But in 2016, you will definite see that 25% number going out because of the sites that we already have signed in both Kansas City and in Denver alike.
Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. And then maybe lastly just on your comp guidance for the year, you've obviously raised it on a full-year basis. It kind of implies a range maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.5% to 5.5% for the rest of the year. And maybe just talk about what might have occurred to put you in the low end or high end, and maybe how we should think about it. Obviously, your 2Q comp is slightly above that range now. And I know some price is falling off, but should we look at it on a two-year basis or if things are good, we'll land here, or roughly, something like – yeah?
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think, Paul – I mean, I think, barring any kind of macroeconomic things, I think you're going to see us continue the trends we have. We feel very confident in that 5% to 6% range. Kind of back to the two-year stats we've kind of really been in that 13%-ish kind of range for a while, kind of low double-digit two year stat. So we feel very confident that moving through Q3-Q4 we're going to remain in that same range.
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
Yeah. And just to add to that keeping in mind, we won't have price in the second half of the year. So if you were really looking at – within that implied rate, it definitely does imply kind of a 3.7% to 5.7% type of range.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah just a point – one other point, I think, it's roughly – in Q3-Q4, it's roughly 70 basis points of price that's rolled off, if you kind of adjust for the back half of the year of the 1.3% price overall.
Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
All right. Good stuff. Right. Congrats on a good quarter. Thanks.
James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller
Thank you.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you. Our last question comes from Stephen Anderson from Maxim Group.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group
Yes. Hello. Good afternoon. Just I thought I wanted to call and ask about, I know some of the other dayparts have been mentioned, but I wanted to avail a little more color on dinner. I know it's been something that you've been trying to grow for the last couple of quarters, and so I just wanted to and I just want to see if there's anything that we should know about in terms of any other entrées that may carry a higher average ticket that you might see having an impact.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Nothing this year. We continued to grow. It's still tracking kind of exclusive of catering around the 40% of overall sales. Again, we're doing cuttings and tastings now for what we will roll out in 2016. And so, again, our focus around menu items will still be around attachment and still be around mostly dinner and catering opportunities, not as much around the lunch daypart. We feel very strongly of where we are at lunch. That said, you may see us over time do some more enhancements in our lunch menu, but – and our lunch offering. That said, I think some of the items we have, we have some pricing ability specifically around dinner, so we'll continue to look and focus on that as we drive this dinner daypart.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group
All right. Thank you.
Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Autodesk Q2 Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. David Gennarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
David Gennarelli - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our second quarter of FY 2016. Also on the line is Carl Bass, our CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investors.
As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call.
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the third quarter and full year FY 2016, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we used to estimate our guidance, including currency headwinds, our transition to new business models, our market opportunities and strategies, and trends for various products, geographies and industries.
We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment, based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015, our Form 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 2015, and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risk factors and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented on the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks, and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to be pleased with the progress of our business model transition. Strong billings, deferred revenue growth and recurring revenue growth were highlights in the second quarter. 55% of the second quarter revenue was recurring compared to just 44% in Q2 last year. What's more, our ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, increased 23% year-on-year in constant currency. That's real progress on the business model transition ahead of what will be the bigger transition period when we discontinue selling new perpetual licenses. We'll talk more about ARR and its importance at our Investor Day event next month.
We're also pleased with the growth of new model subscription types. They continue to show strong year-over-year and sequential growth. Subscription additions in Q2 were led by desktop subscriptions, again comprising more than half of our total subscription adds for the quarter. Since we launched desktop subscriptions last year, we've seen a steady increase in volume and an increase in the percentage of annual contracts, which is now approximately 80%. As expected, AutoCAD LT continues to lead all desktop subscription products, which is important because LT has historically been our highest volume product and represents the biggest opportunity to convert non-subscribing LT customers.
Our channel partners have also been steadily increasing their desktop subscription business. In Q2 last year, approximately 40% of our desktop subs came through our channel partners, and that has increased to approximately 60% this past quarter. Total maintenance subscription additions for the quarter were lower than expected. Despite strong attach and renewal rates, we no longer offer upgrades for non-subscribing customers and we simply had fewer opportunities to attach a maintenance subscription. Our focus for the rest of the year will continue to be on converting non-subscribers to subscribers.
One area that helped drive billings, but was neutral to the subscription count, was an uptick in multi-year maintenance subscriptions. We removed the discount for multi-year maintenance subscription and that prompted a surge of activity. The upside for Autodesk is securing the relationship with the customer for multiple years and collecting the cash up front.
We're quickly approaching the end of this fiscal year when we stop selling new perpetual licenses for stand-alone products. We started the process in Q2 when we stopped selling new perpetual licenses for AutoCAD LT in Australia and New Zealand. The results were very much in line with our expectations. We experienced a surge of buying perpetual LT licenses prior to the cut-off date. Combined seat volume in perpetual LT and desktop subscription LT grew on a year-over-year basis. This is clearly a positive data point as we look ahead to the end of sale of perpetual licenses for most individual products at year end.
Looking at the AEC industry, BIM adoption continues to fuel our business in addition to the general strength of the commercial construction market. We're excited about our cloud-based products like BIM 360 and the recently introduced A360 Collaboration for Revit, which connects building project teams with centralized access to BIM project data in the cloud. This new product had a great win in Q2 where it displaced a competitor on a major U.S. airport project. On the structural engineering side, our new offering, Advance Steel, gained momentum with numerous competitor displacements in the quarter.
Looking at our manufacturing business, our automotive solutions continue to lead the way. We can count almost every car company in the world as a customer. There is broad use of products from conceptual design, all the way through manufacturing, and we've seen substantial expansion of the use of our products throughout the auto industry.
And we're really encouraged by what we're seeing with the adoption of Fusion 360, the first cloud-based 3D CAD system. Fusion 360 connects the entire product development process where users can design, test and fabricate in a single cloud-based tool. Usage is growing quickly and we're delighted to see that the majority of our customers are switching from legacy desktop systems, such as SolidWorks. We'll talk more on how engineering software is moving from the desktop to the cloud at our upcoming Investor Meeting.
Our simulation portfolio experienced strong growth in the second quarter with new business centered in automotive, industrial machinery and consumer products. Simulation provides key insights for our customers to design and manufacture better products. We also saw continued investment from large automotive supply chain customers investing in solutions for advanced materials. Our new NASTRAN-based solutions had wins in many new and existing accounts.
From a geographic standpoint, it continues to be an uneven environment. Strength in the U.S. is being tempered by continued weakness in Japan. Japan impacts both our APAC revenue as well as our PSEB revenue line, as Japan has historically been a significant market for LT. We also saw weakness in most of the emerging economies and despite recent news to the contrary, we saw strength in China last quarter.
Following my comments last quarter, others in the industry have been talking about their approach to the Internet of Things. We believe that capitalizing on this opportunity will require more than applying yesterday's technology. To bolster our efforts in this area, today we announced an agreement to acquire SeeControl, the innovative developer of an enterprise IoT cloud-based platform.
The SeeControl service helps manufacturers and system integrators to net analyze control and manage things remotely. Just as we have changed the CAD, CAM and PLM markets with cloud-based products, we are doing the same with Internet of Things, enabling our customers to easily incorporate IoT capabilities into their projects. This is an exciting area, and we are looking forward to developing it.
Now let me get back to the business model transition. I'll reiterate that this transition is not just about moving to a subscription model. We are transforming our business and the products that our customers use. The cloud is enabling our customers to think differently about how they approach design, simulation, production and collaboration.
I'll also repeat once again that our business model transition will not be perfectly linear, and the amount of business that we transition, the number of subscription additions and the mix of subscriptions issued will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our transition will not look identical to some of the other high profile software company transitions for many reasons, including a significant difference in our customers' price points, competitive position, our channel, and the fact that we already had a maintenance subscription business that represented approximately 40% of our revenue before we started that transition.
We've made good progress in the transition to-date, and we are now ready to accelerate the process. We'll start by ending sales of perpetual licenses of AutoCAD LT in APAC with the exception of Japan at the end of this quarter. Next week we'll announce the date for when we'll stop selling new perpetual licenses for suites, but I'll say that we are accelerating our plans that substantially move up that date.
At our Investor Day event on September 29, we'll provide you with our updated view of our model transition and our enthusiasm about the steady state. In the meantime, new disclosures that we made today around ARR, the percent of recurring revenue and the change in the end of sale stage for perpetual licenses illustrate the progress we've made so far and our plans to capitalize on and accelerate this early success.
As we look at the second half of FY 2016, we remain confident in our billings and subscriptions outlook. We've updated our revenue outlook based on a greater than expected portion of our sales shifting from perpetual licenses to new subscription types which are deferred and recognized ratably. FX headwinds remain persistent, but they haven't gotten much worse than the first half of the year. We continue to believe that FY 2016 will be more back-end loaded than usual given the deadline for end of sale for new perpetual individual product offerings.
To wrap things up, our strong conviction in the model transition is supported by our results. Undergoing this transition will provide our customers with greater flexibility and a better user experience, while creating a more predictable recurring and profitable business for Autodesk in the years to come.
Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. Your line is open.
Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Carl, I just wanted to clarify a comment you made that the lowering of revenues really related to the business model transition, not a material change in the actual core operations or traction you're seeing with your solutions in the market?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, so, Brent, yes, let me try to be as clear as possible, and, Scott, feel free to jump in. It is really just a transition from – so no change in volume in business. This is really about how we're going to recognize the revenue that comes in. And what we saw in this quarter and we're projecting and in some cases programmatically accelerating is that more of the revenue is going to move to ratable, which is just arithmetic, to get to the fact that revenues are lower, even though there's no change in the fundamental business.
Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And just to your comment on Japan. It's been an issue for many vendors, but there's also another issue which I think Adobe has highlighted, that Japan really hasn't made the move to cloud. And I'm curious, as you move the transition to more subscription in cloud, how do you think that market reacts as you start to remove the core? It seems like that may pronounce the weakness there for a little bit longer than perhaps than we think. I'm curious if you could just provide any comments on how you think that will play out?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, sure, Brent. First of all, I think it is true that as we've seen over the years in adopting new technology and business models, Japan has never been the leader, and I don't expect that to change. I mean, one of the ways that we're doing this transition that does give our Japanese customers a way to change is people who have perpetual licenses and maintenance can continue to stay that way. So we will have avenues for people to continue buying that way, and so for the majority of customers, it will change, but they can control it to some degree.
The second thing that's interesting is what I'm seeing which is more anecdotal at this point; there is a split in the Japanese market. So on many of the new things we're doing, so like these new products like Fusion, which is a cloud-based CAD product, we're having dramatically better results in Japan. We're just releasing a Japanese version of the product because it's been so successful, and that kind of runs counter to what we're seeing in the mainstream.
So I wouldn't say that this enthusiasm for the cloud trumps what will be traditional customers' way, but there is a new generation that is looking at doing things differently, and there's definitely at least an undercurrent in Japan of that.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. Thanks, guys, and I appreciate you taking my question. I just had a question on the subscriber mix that you saw this quarter. If I just compare the press releases over the past couple of quarters here, in Q4 you talked about the majority of the subscriber additions being maintenance subscriptions. In Q1, you said half were traditional maintenance, half were new type. And then this quarter, you talked about the majority of subscriptions being the new subscription types. Just wondering what trend you're seeing there? And also, maybe help us think through just the ARPU of sort of a traditional maintenance sub versus the subscription subs? Thanks.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure, Phil. As we look at the trend on the subscriber adds we saw in Q1, the previous quarter, for the first time, roughly a balance between the net subscriber adds that were coming in from maintenance versus those coming in from the new model. And in the quarter, we disclosed they continued to be strong. So the new model sub adds that are – they're just two big elements inside our subscription adds, new model and maintenance. The new model sub adds continue to be strong, both year-on-year and sequentially.
When you look at the maintenance adds for the last quarter, they actually come in two pieces, too. Renewals, so existing maintenance and then new maintenance sold attached to new perpetual license sales. Renewal rates stayed strong and then on the new sales the attach rates stayed strong. What we're seeing, though, that a little bit of downward pressure on the new maintenance adds is really a different pattern this year versus what we saw last year.
Last year when we announced the end of sale of upgrades we saw a pretty linear path of customers buying those upgrades throughout Q2, Q3 and Q4, about the same each quarter. What we're seeing this year is the customers that are going to buy perpetual license at the end of the sale are more back-end loaded. We saw this with the test that we ran in ANZ where it was closer to the end of the actual end of sale in Australia and New Zealand that, that buying activity took place. And we've said all along we think this is going to be a back-end loaded year because of that and that's really the trend that we're seeing inside the subscriber adds.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Then talk about the difference in...
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
In ARPU?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. When you look at ARPU, of course, the overall blended ARPU of those two types is quite different. And even within each type it's very sensitive to whether you're talking a desktop subscription for LT versus a desktop subscription to PrDS. So it's blended to such a level that it's hard to glean a lot of intelligence at the summary level. But when you look between just the average price of a desktop versus the average price of maintenance, a good example would be AutoCAD and an annual maintenance there sells for between 15% and 20% of the SRP of the new license versus a desktop license for a year would sell at about 40%. So, using that as an example, it's roughly half.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Got it. So in other words you did a higher mix of your higher ARPU subscribers as far as the new adds this quarter?
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. That's correct.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Got it. Cool. Thanks, guys.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Oh, terrific. I wonder if you could go back through, you talked about the growth in long-term deferred revenue and you had talked about seeing some long-term contracts with maintenance and something about some dynamic around the renewal of maintenance. Can you just walk us through what drove that growth in long-term deferred revenue on maintenance?
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, sure. Carl mentioned in his opening commentary, we had a strong quarter for multi-year maintenance sales. And so you know what drops in the long-term is anything that's deferred beyond 12 months, and when you sell multi-year there's a bigger component to that than normal. So that's what's driving a bit of an outsized growth. The deferred revenue in total was quite strong, up about $80 million sequentially quarter-on-quarter, driven by what we just said, the higher mix of our sales coming in ratable models versus up front. And then within those ratable models most of your maintenance was strong. And so that dropped an element in the long-term versus current.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And, Steve, what really drove it was we offered a discount for people who were paying up front for multiple years before we announced the elimination of that discount, and so people wanted to get in on it, at least some of it, before that offer expired. So it drove a little bit of business.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sort of a bump in multi-year.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. It just drove multi-year. It didn't drive subscriber count and had no effect on revenue essentially.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, that's the other interesting point is that when you add a multi-year, it's still just one subscriber, so it boosts the billings line, it doesn't necessarily bump the subscriber line.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. And then I was going to ask about the desktop subscription traction you're getting in the channel. What percentage of that is LT? I mean roughly, I'm not looking for a number.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. It's the largest individual piece.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. And it matches the product mix. I mean the one thing I would say about adoption of desktop subscription, just to step back a little bit, is I won't particularly say any industry or product line is any more inclined to do it or not. It seems like our customers are endorsing the move to the new model, and it's pretty consistent across the board.
Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. I had two questions, if you don't mind. The first one, I'm just I guess trying to reconcile again the comments about the transition kind of accelerating with subscription adds showing up of only 61,000 in the quarter. I mean, I know we don't have a ton of history with that, but I'm just trying to reconcile that comment, if you could give some color there?
And then secondarily, I noticed obviously you guys started giving out annualized recurring revenue. And I know that the definition of that is in the glossary, but the 55% that you're showing, the recurring revenue in the table that you have, if we just take subscription revenue I think and divide it by your total revenue, that's about 52% I think of revenue. So is that ARR if we were to try and translate that into numbers? Is that about, I don't know, $18 million or $20 million higher than what your subscription revenue line is showing? I'm just trying to get a sense of what you want us to do with that number besides look at a percentage that's growing. And I want to make sure I'm translating it into dollars appropriately. Thank you.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure, Heather, sure. On your second point, the reason we start to give that out is as we go through the transition and we're in this somewhat hybrid state where we're selling both new model types and perpetual license types, obviously the faster we make the transition, the more people that buy the new model types, the faster recurring revenue, both on an annualized basis and in any given quarter will trend. And so that's the point of providing that and we'll spend more time talking about this...
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
No, no. I know why you're providing it. It's not about why you're providing it. How are we supposed to interpret the 55%? Is that annualized recurring revenue, the 55% you're pointing to, I'm just trying to confirm, is it 55% of the $613 million that you reported, which compares to your subscription revenue, which is about 52% I think off the top of my head of the total? I mean, I'm just trying to get behind the number because...
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
...you're not giving us the dollar amount; you're giving us a percentage. I want to make sure I'm thinking about the percentage the right way.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
You are. It's actually 55% of the $610 million that we reported, but that's right. You're thinking about it...
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yes. Okay. Perfect. Okay. And then to the first question?
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. On your first question, the – I'm sorry, do you want to...
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No. Go ahead, Scott.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, the acceleration that we're talking about again is the acceleration of the transition. And so what you see within the subscriber adds is both new model adds and old model adds, if you want to think of maintenance that way. The new model adds continue to accelerate and so the growth right there both year-on-year is huge. Even it's strong sequentially for the new model adds. And that's why you see us taking actions like going to end of sale in LT in APAC at the end of this quarter everywhere except Japan and we'll announce next week when we hit end of sale for perpetual on suites. So that's the acceleration and that's what is showing up in the subscriber adds.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And the one other comment that we put in there that may have been slightly too obtuse was this idea that what we're seeing with these end of sales is that people are not buying – they're not taking advantage of it until late in the promotion. And so for example, the opportunity on some of these things to attach maintenance to, they're not availing themselves of it. And so I think we will see some unevenness in these numbers on both the maintenance, old maintenance and new subscription as we go through the next two quarters and into next year before we terminate the program.
So there'll be a little bit of volatility there and it's behavior that we're at this point really not that good at predicting. We've never gone through this transition of doing the end of sale of either the individual licenses or the suites. So it's a one-time phenomenon. I think all of us will be slightly imperfect at predicting that.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is open.
Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.
Hi and thank you. Carl, with respect to the termination of the suites, just to be sure we understand what you're saying, you are moving it up from the end of fiscal 2017 as previously planned and so in effect, you've decided to have a rip the BAND-AID moment off, the way Adobe decided to do three years ago. They originally started with a longer transition period in mind and then of course they went to do it much more quickly. So you are in effect doing something similar now. Is that what you mean to do next week?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. I mean, so in essence, you're right. I'm not sure we've ever exactly announced what it was, but I think we certainly intimated it clearly enough. And yes, I think what we saw, we wanted to make sure that both our customers and our channel partners were ready for this transition, and we started out with a model of this that enabled us to take longer to do it than folks like Adobe did. And what we've seen is a willingness, a huge willingness on the part of our customers to use this new model. In many ways, it's much more favorable for them.
And then secondly our channel partners, which we told you were always very vulnerable if we did the rip the BAND-AID off in the beginning, are successfully transitioning their businesses and their customers through this. And so just like many of you, and I can't tell you how many of you have told me, why don't you rip off the BAND-AID? Yes, we're going to have a rip the BAND-AID off moment, and we'll give you the details on it next week and then we can certainly talk about it a month from now when we all get together.
But that was exactly what it was about, and in many ways, this is really beneficial for us. It is non-trivial to run the two things simultaneously. Also we've just in terms of reporting financially, it makes some of the results somewhat confounding. Just, how does this go up and not this go up? And all this does is it accelerates that transition for customers, resellers and certainly for the financial community. And so earlier next year than we had previously planned, we come out of that and start seeing also the economic benefits of that as well.
Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.
You've alluded now a couple of times to the readiness of the channel. To the extent that you do accelerate the business model transition, would you necessarily accelerate the change in the channel model itself, in other words the agency or fee model that we've talked about a number of times? Would the two necessarily go hand-in-hand, as you've also alluded to in the past?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, I mean as you know we are constantly adjusting the channel model. At the very least, it's an annual phenomenon around here. And much of it is kind of carefully planned with the other programs that are in place and in consultation with our partners. And so we've worked really closely with them and many of the things that we think were appropriate for the beginning of the transition we've put in place and we've talked about them before, and as we get towards the end of the transition, we'll move through to those things that we said were coming.
So I think every part of it has to move together to make sense. And so with the acceleration of the announcement of the end of sale, along with it go channel programs and incentives and a number of other things.
Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.
All right. If I could maybe just squeeze one more in, you alluded to focusing on...
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, who would stop you, Jay?
Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.
Maybe Scott.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No, go ahead.
Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.
Thanks. So you alluded, Carl, that in the second half you would focus on unattached or non-maintenance paying customers. Setting LT aside, are you referring specifically to the upgraded but not attached base that was part of the 2.9 million, that famous number from the Analyst Meeting last year?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, yes. The famous 2.9 million.
Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.
Right. But...
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's exactly it.
Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.
Okay. But of that, 1.3 million was upgraded, not attached, not counting LT. So that's the number you're going to be converting?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.
Okay.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well both, Jay. I mean, we'll focus on that LT base as well, right? So the goal will be to, in addition to acquiring new customers with the new models, which we're doing nicely, will be to progressively go after that legacy base, LT and non-LT.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And one of the things that has been a very pleasing upside is just because of the price points and the difference in characteristics amongst our LT customers, we were more anxious about them and the new model transition, and if anything, the adoption there has been as strong as in any other part of the portfolio. And I think we mentioned the one place that we're nervous, which is Japan, which is certainly meaningful in terms of LT, but when you look at, for example, the other industrialized countries, Western Europe, United States, we just don't see much difference there. And fortunately, that simplifies the programs and allows us to do more things holistically. And yes, in a way that makes sense and is easier to communicate to everybody. So we're just going to continue to do that and we're really pleased to see the LT customers coming along.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, and the upside there, of course, is LT had the lowest attach rate previously. When we sold our perpetual, it had the lowest attach rate of maintenance, and so seeing that LT customer set move to desktop gives us a chance to bring them along with us and to pull them in as subscribers.
Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

And your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, guys. So you had a pretty big uptick, actually a very big uptick in subscription billings, up 52% year-over-year but I was hoping, Scott, that you could parse this a little more for us. Can you tell us how much of this growth roughly came from greater end market customer acceptance of your subscription program as opposed to a lengthening in terms just by virtue of the increase in multi-year subs that you referenced?
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. It was both but, of course, the size of our maintenance base is so much bigger, just the base that we've built up over the last 10 years. The number from a pure number standpoint it overwhelms, but we saw strong growth both – crazy growth year-on-year in the new models but strong growth sequentially. But multi-year maintenance also drove a big chunk of that subscriber billings upside and that's just a function of the size of that install base moving.
Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just one for Carl; if you could sort of talk about what you're seeing in terms of activity levels on your eStore, and just when do you expect that eStore could become material for you guys? Thanks.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. I mean, the eStore at this point is becoming material. I mean, we're getting to the point we'll start reporting, maybe we'll start giving you some insight into it, but it is becoming a sizable portion of the business. And I'd say one way to think about it is there's our eStore, but there's just electronic distribution and sales that includes many partners all the way from folks like CDW, Dell and Amazon all the way to our traditional partners doing online distribution.
So electronic sales and distribution is becoming more important. Our eStore, we continue to sell it at this price. So it is a reference marker out there but many people just buy for convenience through there and it's growing substantially. And so quite a good point to take away is we're preparing for Investor Day and talk a little bit more about the electronic channel. But they're clearly the wave of the future and in particular, as we look at many of our new products, many of them are almost exclusively through the electronic channels or at least starting out more even with our traditional channels.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thanks. Scott, I wonder if you could talk about the rental uptick you're seeing and how that may differ or not in manufacturing vertical versus the AEC space?
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Walter, we're not seeing a big – Carl touched on this earlier. We're not seeing a big difference in the uptake rate either by product or by industry vertical at this point. I mean, I guess if you look at it by geo, you might see a slightly slower uptake of the new model types in Japan. But holding that aside, we really are seeing a pretty consistent uptake in the new – the desktop subscription model, which is the rental model, across product lines and across segments.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Got it. And then, Carl, you're buying this, the company on the Internet of Things side and it just seems if I put myself in your place, you guys have quite a bit going on. I guess how do you avoid getting distracted here with a big business model transition and you're now entering a new market, it seems like that could be a risk.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, I mean, well, one of things I'll say, we do acquisitions all the time, kind of routinely. But if you want to step back for a minute and just look at Autodesk in general, there are two big things we're doing. The first one is the business model transition. We've spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks as well as already on the Q&A talking about lots of that and I'm sure we will continue for the next number of months. What sometimes gets lost with all the conversation about that is that we were probably in the biggest transformation in the engineering and design software space we've ever seen, so as big as mainframe to workstation or workstation to PC, the shift of engineering software moving to the cloud is as big and more inevitable than any of those other transitions.
And the alternative to doing acquisitions like SeeControl is to miss out on big parts of the market and we just look and say, well we want to come out of this as not only a more sustainable, less volatile model on the business we have today, we wholly expect to be the leaders in cloud computing for engineering and design and one of the ways to do that is to continue to develop stuff internally, the other is through acquisitions, and whether it's stuff we're doing with PLM 360 or BIM 360 or what we'll do with the Internet of Things, on that side, we think that's really important. And I would at least urge you to look at both the lack of competitive movement there.
Most of our competitors don't think the cloud is that important for their customers. They're making halfhearted to nonexistent attempts to do anything about it. It's a bury your head in the sand kind of strategy. So when you look at it, they are, particularly in legacy business, whether in PLM or anything else. So we've let these things like the Internet of Things or moving CAD or PLM or CAM to it as being a critical part of what Autodesk looks like a handful of years from now.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, and, Walter, the other think I would just add to that, because your question was about distraction, I don't see Internet of Things as a net new segment for us. It fits very much hand-in-glove with where we're headed in manufacturing, and where we're headed in AEC. So it's more of an adjunctive to a couple of pretty strategic segments we are already in, than it is something that's net new that we're adding to the plate that we now have to build entirely different structures for.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. I think some others in the market have positioned it as a new segment. I think Scott is absolutely right, and if you just break it down a little bit, I don't know anyone building commercial buildings nowadays who are not thinking about instrumenting and monitoring their buildings to improve the efficiency of running their operations. And whether that's a commercial real estate or industrial space such as a factory, or a power plant, everybody is doing it. I think very few people are designing new products that aren't number one, enhanced by Internet of Things technology. And I think most everybody is trying to collect data and analyze it so they can build better products for the future. And so this is really kind of the foundation of technology to get that started, and we certainly have more work to build into a business. But I think it dovetails exactly with our existing businesses.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker
Hi. This is Maggie Nolan (38:56) in for Anil. My first question is on the new incentives. You mentioned that there had been a discount for customers buying subscriptions up front. And I'm wondering are there any other incentives that you will be rolling out to help accelerate the transition to the subscription base and how you hope to achieve that subscription that we'll need to see in the second half, given that that's where your guidance has remained consistent?
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. So, let me just be clear on this one. So the first one was, what we were trying out on the subscriptions was the renewal – was the removal of a promotion. And people buying ahead of that removal.
Unknown Speaker
Okay.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And so that was just the discounts going away, and people just saying I want to buy now and pay less. What I think you will see going forward is we will continue to promote the move to desktop subscriptions. We'll talk a little bit more about it next week and beyond that and I think if anything, the bias right now, is to accelerate that and promote it more. Having seen the success we saw was to kind of double-down on that and encourage people to move more quickly. I think it serves all of us well to do that.
Unknown Speaker
Okay. Makes sense. And then my second question was you mentioned that China wasn't much of a headwind in the second quarter. I'm hoping you can give a little more color around your view on that going forward? And what kind of limited that headwind in the second quarter?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I wish I could. That is one of the confounding things amongst many. Yes, there are certain places in which the economic reports coincide nearly perfectly. We're seeing really strong business in the U.S. and all the economic reports out of the U.S. including the one this morning continue to be strong. And it actually lines up with everybody's kind of impressions. You walk around major cities and there are cranes everywhere, the job market is tight, unemployment is low.
China always on the reporting side is a little bit of a trickier place to actually understand and I don't really understand to what degree and the flip side of that is Japan is where there's definitely some dissonance between our results and the overall economic one. We're digging into it a little bit more to understand. I'd say at this point we have an imperfect understanding and just for everyone, I mean, we spend a little bit of time trying to understand it. But in some of these things, when it goes beyond what's actionable and what we would do differently as a result of understanding it, it starts being diminishing returns for us to play macroeconomists.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, Maggie (41:41), maybe the better way to think about China is to step back and say what drove that growth in the quarter, and it's obviously China is a very active construction market. I've been there, as Carl said, you see cranes everywhere. BIM is actually taking off in China. You look at major projects like the new Shanghai Tower and it's being built with BIM start to finish. So that's what's fueling the growth. I think the second part of your question what to expect given the events of the last five days or six days, that's the one where it's kind of a, who knows, at this point.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. Some of our theories include things like the government has been putting a lot of money into infrastructure projects and some of their injection into the economy are things that generally benefit our kinds of customers but that's a little bit of speculation on our part. But it is possible and once again, it's one quarter data point now that we're kind of lined up we'll see going forward what we see in the next quarter.
Unknown Speaker
Sure. Great. That helps. Thanks for taking my questions.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. I've gotten a few emails from investors. There's a lot of terms being floated around during the call and I think there's some confusion. Can you clarify for investors when you talk about the new model, how much of that are you talking about in terms of pure product subscription versus maintenance versus anything else. Just clarify the term for some of the investors.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure, Sterling, and we started talking about this last quarter as well. And when I say new model I'm thinking of certainly desktop, cloud and our enterprise business agreements. So everything that is ratable and subscription based is what I would drop into the new model. And then if you look at what's not there, obviously the biggest chunk is our maintenance business that's tied to our perpetual licenses, and then there's some smaller consulting and some smaller CFIN and some other bits. But think of new model as desktop, cloud and EBA, largely.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great. And the other big topic for last couple of weeks from investors is, Carl, go back to that Analyst Day when you talked about the 12% billings CAGR, 20% uplift in customer value, 50% increase in subscriber, especially that 12% CAGR in billings has been the one that's been on investors' minds. Can you either comment tonight or at least give us some idea if you're going to talk about how that actually shapes out under the new accelerated transition when we get to Analyst Day?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, I think probably the best thing to do is to tell you that we will talk about it at the Investor Day, and what we will do is we will update the financial model and our understanding of how the transition continues. And so we'll show you lots of detail about that and hopefully remove some of the confusion that exists about how we go about it. And what we did a little bit as a preview is to start pointing at some of the metrics that we think are more appropriate to understand the transition. We told you at the time, some of these were our best guess and mapped most easily to the history before it, and we said as we learned more about it and understood it better and would better pinpoint the things that we're looking at. And I think we did that today and we'll do more of it at the upcoming Investor Day.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, Sterling, your notes have actually touched on a lot of the key dynamics in that transition as we move from a hybrid cloud model to one that is much more pure subscription model.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC
No, I appreciate that. Last quick one, as you look at the last two quarters and the subscribers, is there anything in terms of seasonality or dynamics that would change one quarter versus the other in terms of total number of subscribers that we might expect or the mix in terms of those that are pure product subscription or desktop subscription customers?
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, I think obviously that the big effect that we'll see on total subscriber adds in the second half will be the attach rate, which we've said our attach rate of maintenance has grown materially over the last four quarters. It continues to be strong, and so as we see that end of sale of perpetual licenses at the end of Q4, a lot of those perpetual licenses with our current attach rate, that will drive a significant uptick in subscribers in Q4. For the new model types, they continue to grow – we're not seeing any seasonality in the new model types yet. They're growing year-on-year and they're growing sequentially at this point.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, I think we'll begin to understand seasonality in them later, but right now, they're so overwhelmingly affected by our promotions and the timing of announcement like end of sales that I would say that's certainly the first order effect and any seasonality is the second order one that won't get sorted out till later.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Maybe just dig in on that subscriber count a little bit. Last year you guys saw a big seasonality into the second half of the year as upgrades went out, I think it was up like 36% from the first half into the second half. This year to get to the midpoint of your guidance you're looking for an even bigger seasonality and it seems like the answer of sort of how you get that bigger seasonality is the expiration of perpetual licenses on a significant part of your product portfolio.
So it's a two-part question, like, one, is that the right view, that is sort of primarily what you see, sort of a bolus of (47:35) subscribers into the back half? And two, maybe a little bit more philosophical, how do we understand sort of the true level of underlying demand when the past two years have been heavily influenced by these expirations? Or how do you guys get confidence into the level of underlying demand?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So the answer to your first question is yes. You're fundamentally thinking about it correctly, and we do expect it to be much more back-end loaded because of the size and the importance of the products that will no longer be sold beyond the end of the year.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. But just for a bit of an order of magnitude on that, we talked about it being roughly half of our new model types. So not maintenance attached to perpetual, the new stuff, being roughly half of Q1 and better than half of our Q2 sub adds. So you can start to get a sense of it's not a new material – it's not a huge revenue driver at this point, in terms of our subscriber adds, it is a pretty significant chunk of our subscriber adds; the new model types. But yes, fundamentally what will drive the significant uptick in the second half is the end of sale of perpetual at the end of Q4.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And then secondarily, just on the more philosophical, what we keep on emphasizing and we'll give you more insight to in a month, is that the business level remains where we expected it. The big difference is the way people are choosing to buy the products. It's not about the underlying business demand. It is fundamentally about the way they choose and, therefore, with the way they choose the way we account for that. And that's why we as well as you I'm sure are looking forward to when it all becomes back to a single model. We told you at the very beginning of this that the hardest part was going to be running a hybrid model where you have two, because goodness in one model looks like badness in the other and vice versa. They just eat away at each other and so getting back to a more holistic single model will be good, and that's back to Jay's comment about ripping off the BAND-AID. What we said, and we'll give details next week, is we're going to do that sooner than we were otherwise planning on doing.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Got it. On the SeeControl acquisition, I think Walter was talking about the potential for distraction coming from SeeControl. I think the other risk that investors see is OpEx growth coming from it. The longer-term target is assumed there'll be relatively muted OpEx growth over the next couple of years. Is SeeControl or acquisitions of this type, is that putting that let's call it mid-single digit OpEx growth profile for the next couple of years, does that put it at risk, by any sense?
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Not at all. The acquisitions like SeeControl and the others are all within the same envelope. When we gave that guidance, and as we move through it, we're consistent to that. We presumed it in the beginning even though we didn't know which acquisitions, and as we consider them internally, they are all within that. And you saw the OpEx growth this quarter that kind of – I mean it's right in line with everything that we told you would be the OpEx growth, and so no. These acquisitions are not at all – and as we've said before, both the small and this one getting to a medium size, wouldn't do that. The only exception I would ever say is if there happened to be a large one, I'm not saying there is one. We are not contemplating it any time. But as you know, large acquisitions and the costs they bring in the first year would affect that. But that is not in the plans and we're holding true to the mid-single digits OpEx growth.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then one last one from me, just in terms of free cash flow growth; you guys had talked about free cash flow growth being in line with billings growth. Mix shift has taken the revenues down a little bit, but I wouldn't expect that – that should not probably impact, since billings expectations stay the same, that billings and free cash flow model should stay roughly aligned?
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, that's right. I mean the top line of – so free cash flow the way I would define it, is cash flow from ops minus CapEx. There's no significant changes coming in CapEx. The top line of the cash flow from ops is net income, and that will flow off of billings.
Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush. Your line is open.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Just focused on the new model subscriptions here. I'm trying to rationalize some of the commentary with what we heard from the checks in which the desktop subscriptions, that promotion didn't seem to be doing nearly as well as the license plus extended maintenance promotion. And I'm wondering if the – you know, the success that you're having in the new model adds, could it be that given the lower ARPUs for the cloud products, is that helping significantly? And then maybe one follow-up on that as well.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, no, it's not about the cloud subscription. This is really comparing maintenance subscriptions to desktop subscriptions. I don't know how to answer the resolving it with the channel checks...
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Yes.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
...that's always been a riddle beyond my pay grade. But no, don't think of it as something else and there's something not to understand. This is exactly people moving to desktop subscription for the kinds of products you imagine.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, that's exactly right. And the checks are – I think everyone knows this, but it's very difficult to extrapolate from a small subset to worldwide growth...
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
...and it's just always subject to variability.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I mean, just from your point of view, because of our interactions with the channel is different, we're always somewhere between bewildered and bemused at reading the notes on channel.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Sure. Sure.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And sometimes they're strikingly accurate and uncannily so and other days we're like did they talk to someone who had a bad day. And so we can tell you what we know about it but I mean, just to be very clear about that think of that as maintenance versus desktop subscriptions.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. So that's helpful. I guess for the follow-up kind of related, so it's not fair to ask you what's different about my checks, but I guess maybe going back to the mix, maybe the mix of people selling the desktop subscriptions. I would just comment we heard that most of the resellers were short of – well short of the goal that Autodesk gets set for them for the year and there was a lot of inconsistency around what that goal was. So, is that – yes, go ahead, sorry, Carl.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, no, no, sorry, Steve, go ahead.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Just to finish it off.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
You were posing the question.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Yes. Just to close that off, we're guessing that it seems that larger resellers are doing better. Is there a mix differences across the size of the resellers? You're clearly concentrating your efforts on making life better for those large resellers; just maybe any insight there or further commentary.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. So first of all, sorry for trying to cut you off there.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
No problem.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
What I'd say is as we get deeper into this we'll do more analysis on it. Right now we don't have any distribution that looks dramatically different there. I mean, it's certainly an interesting question as to whether or not we're seeing anything there but I would say for the most part we did not see any of that.
R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, and we haven't structured the back-end so as to be different for large versus small, any more so than the normal channel structure would dictate. So there's nothing there that would favor that.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay, okay...
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, you know – yes.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Sorry, Carl, go ahead.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, I was just thinking that the mix of distributors and stuff out there and just going – but what we'll try to do is a month from now, we'll try to give you a little bit better insight into whether we see any variability in terms of the performance, but there's nothing that jumps out at us through the analysis of the quarter results that gave us any indication about that. But one thing I would say, though, about goals, and I think sometimes this is misconstrued in terms of people doing channel checks; it is true that sometimes our sales management team gets aggressive when we want new programs.
I'm just trying to send a message of what's important. I think in more steady state businesses where we really understand the performance you might set your overall target at 102% of what you expect, and the 2% on for example $600 million a quarter when it's relatively steady state is understandable. When we move to new things, sometimes we get aggressive and sometimes there is a little bit of a – assigned to the channel partners. Just directionally, this is where we expect you to have we think this is what's important and so sometimes some of the sales targets out there are more aggressive and they're definitely not consistent in terms of targets relative to what we think we will attain.
Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Okay, well thank you very much for taking my questions.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Your line is open.
Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey, thanks. So I know the cloud kind of helps you guys compete better, but one of the hardest parts that I hear from guys that are thinking about switching or companies that are thinking about switching from one vendor to another is the fear that the engineers have with regard to their old models won't translate over seamlessly. So how are you guys channeling that concern? Is that still an issue, or is that a legacy issue? Is that a data issue or is it not an issue at all? Thanks.
Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, I think this used to be a huge issue in the industry. One of the things that we've done with both our cloud and with the products is hopefully made it more of a non-issue. We will read in models from almost any vendor, dozens and dozens of different formats and operate on them almost as if they're natively. And I think, look, I would be worried if I had a 77 set of plans with 12 million parts in it. So the question is not does it translate, but how do you check that it translated 100% correctly?
And so I think there are some industries that will be slower in adopting this, but I think we're getting to the point where the majority, the mainstream of customers, deal with files that come from heterogeneous systems every day and have worked through that and have come to trust that the translation of these things just works well.
The one thing that's really good about this is moving this to the cloud has, digging a little bit deeper on the technical side, two nice benefits is that number one is the translations that existed in desktop products we were not able to see and could not see the failures of. When they're on the cloud, you can look at the failures. The second thing is as you recognize whatever shortcomings there are in the translation process, you can update those translations instantaneously. So there's a lot of benefits. Sort of while we're wholly protecting the customers' data and IP, you can actually give them a much better experience, and so it's one of the many benefits of doing this cloud-based engineering.
Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Great. Thanks so much.

Sure, Richard.

P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Liz. Good afternoon and thanks everyone for joining us. With me on today's call is Jeff Buchanan, our Chief Financial Officer. Later in the call, Jeff will provide a recap of our financial performance, as well as our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2016. We are very pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered revenue and net income that exceeded our expectations.
Our performance reflects the successful execution of our growth strategy as we focus on our core firearms business and related outdoor spaces. The combined results of our firearms and accessories divisions indicate to us that consumer demand and the preference for our products was stronger than anticipated. Based upon our first quarter results and our current outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2016, we are raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance.
Let me provide a few highlights from the first quarter. Total company revenue of $147.8 million delivered double-digit growth over the prior year.
Adjusted NICS background checks were up 10.1% for our first quarter, a strong indication of a healthy consumer market for firearms, while our units shipped into the consumer channel for the same period were up 11.7%. Our data sources and analysis continue to support our belief that we remained the market leader in the consumer channel for the handgun and modern sporting rifle categories.
Distributor inventory of our firearms increased, as planned, by 65,000 units, to a total of 177,000 units at the end of Q1. This rise, as I explained on last quarter's call was required to support upcoming fall hunting, the holiday shopping season, and our promotional plans. Distributor inventory have since declined significantly primarily as a result of our recently launched summer promotions.
Accessories division revenue was $13.3 million versus no revenue last year, a period prior to our purchase of Battenfeld Technologies, or BTI. The $13.3 million of BTI revenue represents 29.9% growth from their prior year results. Accessories gross margins continued to be strong and came in at over 50%.
During the quarter, we introduced limited edition models of our M&P BODYGUARD 380 pistol and Model 642 J-Frame Revolver. Our product development teams in both the firearms and accessories divisions continue to work hard preparing a significant number of new products and line extensions for launch at SHOT Show in January.
Before I share more detail, Jeff will review our financial results.
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
Thanks, James. Revenue for the quarter was above the top-end of our guidance range at $147.8 million, which was up 12.1% from the prior year. Revenue from our firearms division was $134.4 million, an increase of 1.9% over the prior year, and revenue from our accessories division was $13.3 million.
In firearms, handgun revenue of $100.7 million, decreased by 2.8%, while units shipped increased by 2.2%. Long gun revenue of $21.3 million was up by 27.9%, while units shipped increased by 30.8%.
Gross margin for the quarter was 39.8% compared to 37.2% in the prior year. Even with higher promotional costs in the current quarter, gross margin increased by 260 basis points due mainly to better fixed cost absorption from increased volumes of production in firearms and the favorable impact of accessories' gross margins. This result falls within our targeted range of 37% to 41%.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $29.1 million or 19.7% of revenue compared to $23.4 million or 17.8% in the prior year. Total first quarter operating expenses rose due to the inclusion of $5.9 million of accessories related operating expenses. Within that amount, there was $2 million in purchase accounting amortization related to the acquisition of BTI.
In the firearms division, operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in compensation, profit sharing, R&D and other expenses but were netted down by one-time insurance recovery of $1.8 million.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the amortization and the one-time insurance recovery, operating expenses were $28.7 million or 19.4% of revenue compared to $22.9 million or 17.4% of revenue last year.
Our operating margin was 20.2% for the first quarter compared to 19.5% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis the operating margin was 20.5% in Q1 compared to 19.9% in the prior year.
Our GAAP EPS for Q1 came in at $0.26, which was the same as last year. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.32, substantially above the top end of our guidance and above last year's non-GAAP EPS of $0.27. Adjusted EBITDAS in Q1 was $38.8 million or a 26.3% EBITDAS margin compared to 25.8% in the prior year. Our goal is to maintain EBITDAS margins above 20%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was a positive $16.6 million despite the fact that we build our internal inventory for the upcoming fall hunting and holiday shopping seasons. As a result, cash during the quarter increased by $13.2 million to $55.4 million.
CapEx spending during the quarter was $7.9 million. We expect to spend up to $50 million in total on CapEx this fiscal year, primarily relating to further enhancements to manufacturing flexibility, tooling for several important new product introductions and various IT projects.
At the end of Q1, we had no borrowings on our $175 million line of credit. We had long-term debt of $180 million comprised of the $105 million unsecured term loan A due June 2020 and $75 million of unsecured senior notes due June of 2018 and callable next summer.
The term loan A accrues interest at a defined rate of 3.3%, and the CDOs accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5%. James?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Jeff. Before I describe our observation of channel conditions and provide an operational update, let me point out that this quarter we have begun providing you with our firearms unit shipped data in our 10-Q, which was filed today. We believe this data will help to better convey our results within our consumer channel relative to these NICS results.
In our first quarter, adjusted NICS results, which we believe provide a good indicator of consumer retail activity, validated our belief in the long-term growth prospects of the firearms market. Adjusted NICS for Q1 grew strongly by 10.1% over the prior year.
In looking at the detail within the quarter, the June to July trend line over the past seven years is typically flattish, yet this year, July NICS had a pronounced sequential increase, up over June by 6.7%. This acceleration in consumer buying activity doesn't typically occur until August each year. It is also important to note that this was the highest recorded July ever.
Now turning to NICS by product category. For our first quarter, NICS handgun checks were up 17.5%, while our units shipped into the consumer channel grew by only 7.7%. We believe the lower number of handgun units we shipped relative to NICS is a reflection of retailers bringing down their healthy level of inventory before the commencement of our summer promotional activity.
Turning to long guns. NICS long gun checks reflect 1.3% year-over-year increase, while our units shipped into the consumer channel were exceptionally strong, up 45.5%. This growth was driven by successful promotions on two key products. The first of these is our opening price point M&P15 Sport rifle, which remains very popular with consumers.
The second is our Thompson/Center Venture bolt-action rifle. Our recent focus on Thompson/Center is intended to create a solid platform for growth and market share gains in the hunting rifle category in the coming years.
Now turning to operations. As we continue to position our company for growth, a key component of our plans will be the continual enhancement of our flexible manufacturing model. Our focus over the last few years on adding capacity through both outsourcing and internal investments has served us well and has provided a solid and highly adaptable manufacturing platform for cyclical growth.
By utilizing our source capacity, we have been able to significantly adjust our production volumes up or down in response to changing consumer demand and at the same time, by leveraging overall manufacturing flexibility, we have been able to shift production mix between various product categories in response to changing consumer preferences.
As a result, we have successfully demonstrated our ability to navigate corrections in our marketplace, whilst maintaining very healthy gross margins. The primary benefit of our outsourcing strategy is the flexibility to quickly scale unit production when needed without building costly new facilities. As such, we believe the execution of our plans to continually enhance the flexibility of our manufacturing capacity will deliver incremental value in the future.
Turning to new products. As a consumer-centric company, we continue to maintain a very robust new product pipeline. As Jeff mentioned, we have slated up to $50 million in CapEx for fiscal 2016. The most important focus of our expenditures will be in new product development. Across our organization and by firearms and accessories, we currently have more than 120 new products and line extensions in development; many of which will be unveiled at SHOT Show this January.
In firearms, we'll continue to expand our flagship M&P brand that is so popular with consumers. In addition, we have a number of products in development under our Smith & Wesson, Thompson/Center and Performance Center brands, some of which represent exciting new product areas for us.
In accessories, we continue to execute aggressive new product development plans to expand the product portfolio and drive future revenue growth. While our accessories division only makes up about 10% of our total revenue today, it clearly has the potential to continue delivering double-digit annual revenue growth, both organic and inorganic, as well as very attractive gross margins.
With that, let me turn back over to Jeff for our financial outlook.
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
Thanks, James. For full fiscal year 2016, we are increasing our guidance and now expect revenue to be between $610 million and $620 million, and non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.14 and $1.19. That non-GAAP EPS would exclude $0.08 for expenses related to the redemption in Q1 of our 5.875% notes and $0.19 for acquisition-related amortization, partially offset by an expense reduction of $0.03 related to the insurance settlement, and then $0.09 for the net tax effect of these adjustments. Therefore, we expect GAAP EPS of between $0.99 and $1.04 for fiscal 2016.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we expect revenue to be between $135 million and $140 million. We expect second quarter non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.19 and $0.21 and that non-GAAP outlook excludes $0.05 for acquisition-related amortization partially offset by the tax effect of $0.02, so that the GAAP EPS outlook is expected to be between $0.16 and $0.18.
With regard to the back-half of our fiscal year, keep in mind our typical seasonality. As a reminder, our third quarter generally rises slightly over Q2 and then Q4 is typically our strongest quarter.
And lastly, all of our estimates are based on our current fully diluted share count of 55.8 million shares and expected tax rate of 37%. James?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Jeff. I want to thank everyone at Smith & Wesson for delivering a great quarter. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions from our analysts.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Steven Cahall, Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Thank you and congratulations. Looks like it was a very strong quarter. Maybe just a first question on the margin, can you talk a little bit about both the gross margin and the EBIT margin, and if there was anything exceptional in the first quarter because to me they looked pretty strong and as I think what's implied in Q2 it looks like you've got a big step-down to hit that Q2 guidance, so is that gross margin related, is that expenses related, and then kind of finally (19:23) the question, maybe you can kind of take us through the same things for the full year, that would be great?
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
Yeah. There was nothing exceptional in the gross margin. It mainly was the result of good absorption from high production levels. Obviously, our accessories business added 110 basis points over the prior comparable quarter. As we move forward, there's more promotional activity in Q2, which would impact our gross margins in Q2.
Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the share repurchase plan that you've announced, it looked like you didn't buy any shares back in the quarter. So how are you thinking about executing on that plan in terms of where the share price has been?
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
All right. Well, we don't really look at solely in regards to the share price. It's more of an analysis of our best use of cash at any particular given time. Right now we're investing in the business. We're building inventory, as you can see inventory increased this quarter, getting ready for like the fall season. We're spending up to $50 million in CapEx this year, and particularly in related to several new upcoming product introductions and then a lot of the tooling for the flexible manufacturing that James mentioned.
Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then just a final one on inventory. I think you mentioned that it seems like retail or distributor inventories are low, so does that mean you don't think that there was any sort of pull-forward of sales by distributors or retailers in the quarter, and that those are the kind of trends we're seeing we shouldn't see any sort of reversing back to a lower growth rate related to inventory normalization?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
All right, Steven, did you say at the beginning that you thought we said inventory was low at retail and not wholesale?
Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC
I thought I heard you say that distributor inventories were low, which would lead me to the conclusion that we didn't really have any pull-forward of sales into the first quarter that might then drop out in the back end of the year, so I'm trying to just get you to – if you give a little more color if that's correct.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay, Steven. Yeah, in terms of inventory, we didn't really say that we're low. What we said is we'd increase them as planned, that was a 65,000-unit increase, that since the end of the first quarter, they had declined significantly as a result of the commencement of our summer promotional activity. I think retail inventory and wholesale inventory as a whole is fairly healthy. I think it's in a good position of our products for the busy fall season coming up and then obviously into the holiday season as well. So we're excited about that. So we're always looking to optimize our distribution.
As Jeff said, we're building our own inventory internally as well in anticipation of a very busy fall and holiday season. And then of course, once you're at the other side of Christmas, you're into an even busier season because you're going to hit the wholesaler shows then, obviously, that's when retailers are invited by wholesalers to these shows where they place orders for the upcoming calendar year.
Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Stember, C.L. King. Please proceed.
Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Good afternoon and very nice quarter, guys.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Scott.
Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Can you maybe talk about – on inventory you had said that it has come down since quarter end, maybe just frame it up with your normal comments about weeks of coverage and your comfort level, how you're feeling heading into the busy fall season?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'm very comfortable with the level of inventory that we see out there right now. I mean, we expect and I said this in the prepared remarks as well, that inventory will gradually go back up again at wholesale in the quarter. I mean, it's a very busy period in terms of our promotional activity.
We said for on a number of calls now that we're going to be aggressive in terms of our promotional activity as we continue to grow the company by taking market share so that activity is kicking in for sure. And then once you get past Labor Day, that's when you'll start to see more foot traffic in at retailers, and we're very excited to see that happening as well.
It was interesting to see the acceleration of NICS checks in July over June. That is unusual when you look back at the history. Doesn't normally happen till August. So we're looking at interest right now, what's happening at retail and look forward to getting the NICS checks results once we complete August.
Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Got it. And you had made some comments about the – on the handgun side, you had underperformed the market and you talked about some inventory that was out there and just – can you maybe just talk about what's happened since then and how you would expect the Smith & Wesson products to perform versus NICS in the quarters ahead?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Difficult to say. I mean, we really don't go down to that granular detail. What you have to remember what happens in Q1, a lot of retailers are still receiving shipments from their orders that they made at the wholesaler shows in January or February and that's really what helps them have these healthy inventory levels through the quieter summer months and allows them to get ready for the busy fall season. So our expectation is that retail – again, the retail foot traffic increases, but their inventories will go lower and then obviously replenishment will kick in at a higher level as well.
Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And just looking at the numbers, Jeff, real quick, what was the implied tax rate for the $0.32 in the first quarter?
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
37%.
Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Okay.
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
Well, actually, if you want to get technical, it's 36.3%, if you want to get precise.
Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
That's great. And just last question. Last quarter you talked about the Modular Handgun System contract that's up for bid. Can you maybe just talk about where it stands right now and where you guys are looking with your JV that you have with General Dynamics?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. With waiting the RFP, our expectation is that that will be released very soon. It's certainly in its final stages of review. We know that for sure, but for the exact timing we don't know. The relationship with General Dynamics is going great. Our two teams are working extremely well together, and we can see lots of mutual benefits going forward not only in the Modular Handgun System area.
Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And just let me just sneak one last one in. You talked about continuing on your path of being much more flexible with regards to capacity. How much more flexible can you become as we go through a nice recovery here, just given with your footprint where it is right now before you have to physically increase your size and your scale?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So, really, Scott, what you're asking is what's our upside in terms of our available capacity?
Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Exactly.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Okay. So this is the great thing about outsourcing is our supply chain team does a great job here of casting the net far and wide, reaching out to people who have the same CNC metal cutting technology as we do. That can become very quickly outsourced partners with us and get into production of pistol slides or barrels and so on.
We have a fairly broad base of suppliers right now that have some available capacity, and we also are aware of others that we can contact and tap into their available capacity as well should we need to do that.
So, it is great, because it's so flexible, and remember, we're still investing in our own base capacity so that increases. We like to keep the outsourcing at a certain limit, so that we don't introduce too much risk into the supply chain, but I have to say that's a fairly significant amount of our capacity right now. And as you go into a very busy period, such as the one we believe that we're going to go into, we can flex up fairly well.
Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Got it. That's all I had and thanks for taking my questions.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Scott.

Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr, Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC
Yes. Thank you and great quarter, guys. So people don't talk about it a whole lot but your professional business was down about $6 million in the quarter, and if I kind of look back over time, it seems like over the full year it tends to be in the mid-60%s or has the last couple of years. Where should we expect that because it looks like the consumer is even more impressive when you look at the decline you had year-over-year?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. As we've always said the professional business can be lumpy in nature for sure. We've had some constraints on some of our international shipments, for example, Thailand being one good example there.
Again, I come back to the lumpiness. I think that's the biggest factor here. We know that we've been working very hard with our Law Enforcement Distributors here in the U.S. So we think there's some good opportunities there going forward. So really I guess what I'm saying is our expectation is that it wouldn't stay at this level. You'll see that lumpiness going forward, but I think we'll be getting things back to a more normal level of revenue.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC
So then 60% or mid-60%s is a reasonable guess for the year? Because if it is, I mean, it assumes that as we get to the second half, it would look like that the firearm sales compares, despite having more manufacturing days, would basically be flat to down after being up. That's a little confusing.
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
Well, I guess, we don't give guidance by a channel, Cai. And so, all I can say is that, as James said, professional is lumpy. It's difficult to forecast, and so we tend to be quite conservative in our forecast of that.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC
Got it. And then you had mentioned...
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
I just want to emphasize, there's nothing particularly going on in that channel, other than it's generally like lumpy nature.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC
And then maybe refresh our memory, Battenfeld, their seasonal pattern versus yours?
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
Yeah. This is also a low quarter for them. They're much more consumer oriented. So our second and third quarters are big quarters for them because of the retail shopping season and hunting.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC
Terrific. And then, so your gross margin for the year, I mean, given the manufacturing, it looks like you don't have much in the way of year-to-year gains implied because you've started out with such a strong level. Maybe give us some color on what you're expecting for gross margin for the year?
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
Well, I think somebody already asked the question that sort of implied that if you do the math, you can sort of see a reduced gross margin in Q2 because of promotional activity. But the best we can – we don't give any particular guidance, and so what I said earlier is that we expect it to be within our targeted range, and our targeted range is 37% to 41%.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay.
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
But again, you just got to remember what is coming up is we have down days in Christmas, because we shut down for 10 days at Christmas. We have holidays in November, Thanksgiving. And then the bulk of our promotional activity occurs at the distributor shows, and so that's upcoming in Q3 and Q4, so...
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And we have to think, Cai, that promotional activity we said we're going to be aggressive. This is very much a promotional-driven industry. We have the gross margins to leverage here. We have what we believe the best margins in the industry, so why not leverage that. Q1 is really the only quarter, which is free of aggressive promotional activity, and really kicks in quarter two, goes in quarter three as well with the tail end as we start the wholesaler shows. We got SHOT Show there as well, where we'll launch many new products. And then in Q4 you got a continuation of that wholesaler buying group shows as well, a lot of promotional activity in quarter three and quarter four.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC
Got it. And then the last one on your cash flow, should it be positive in the second quarter because it looks like your balance sheet is in really terrific shape? I mean, you basically – your payables are low, so it's not like you (34:37) and under what circumstances would you consider share repurchase? Thanks.
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
Yeah. Well, actually, in the second quarter, we have our profit sharing payment, which is big. James has a rule on the introduction of new products that we won't announce a new product unless a certain number of units of that product are in the channel. So we are building inventory with new products over the course of Q2 also. So we don't give a forecast on cash but, I mean, generally, I don't think it's going to be a big cash generation quarter.
Historically speaking, quarter four is our biggest cash generation quarter and quarter one is okay. And quarter two also has the – occasionally has the impact of our two-week shutdown in the summer. So those are the typical cash impacts.
Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you very much.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Cai.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrea James, Dougherty & Company. Please proceed.
Andrea Susan James - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. First one, just Walmart said that they were pulling MSRs because they were seeing poor sales and you guys are obviously seeing the opposite. So my question is, are you seeing some changes in the way your products are sold? Is the distribution channel changing, maybe more mom-and-pops taking share? I'm just curious how you interpret that data point?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I don't think it's much of a data point to pay any attention to personally. There are large retailers who have been in and out of firearms on a regular basis. They have no continuity. Walmart is an example, obviously, has a very large store count and footprint, but not all stores would sell firearms, for example. So, it can be pretty misleading for sure.
Andrea Susan James - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Okay. And then my second question and forgive me if you've done this before, but it was the first time I've noticed that you've broken down NICS by long gun and handgun, and it seems to be a new data point, so I'm curious, first of all, it's very helpful, so thank you. But second of all, where does the data come from and how are you interpreting that?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Where does the data for breaking NICS between handgun and long gun come from, was the question?
Andrea Susan James - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Exactly. Yeah.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Off the FBI website.
Andrea Susan James - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Okay. Sorry about that, okay. And then also summer is doing a little better than expected, do you think that like shooting is becoming more of a summer sport or I guess, what's going on in the marketplace?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's very interesting. I mean I just come back to that – we have a lot of data that supports our belief that in the long term the market is growing. More and more people – we've got a lot of research that more and more people have shown interest in the shooting sports in the last five years, change in the demographics, more women than ever before, younger generation, more people from urban areas versus suburban areas, a lot of things that we've discussed, all discussed in the past is part of our investor presentation, so that dynamic is still in play. Were we surprised by the NICS result in July? Yes. Was it pleasant surprise? Very. It's a good thing. It's very encouraging for the future.
Andrea Susan James - Dougherty & Co. LLC
And then finally, you said 120 new products in development or product extension, how does that compare to historically? That's all. Thank you.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Difficult to compare historically because, obviously, now we have two divisions, firearms and accessories, a large number of those new products will come from the accessories division for sure. So I think in the future we'd be able to do a better job of making that comparison, but I would definitely say there's a healthy increase, a fairly significant increase over last year.
Andrea Susan James - Dougherty & Co. LLC

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with BB&T Capital. Please proceed.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - BB&T Securities LLC
Yes. Thank you very much. Great quarter.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Brian.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - BB&T Securities LLC
Yeah. So you beat by $0.10 on an adjusted basis, yet you raise the guidance by $0.12. Help me understand, I know that people have been chiseling around the edges on this. It seems like everything is picking up, and I just want to understand why you didn't raise more – by more, am I missing something?
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
No. I guess we do our analysis of what we think the year is going to do based on a lot of inputs. This quarter was a good quarter and exceeded our expectations. We have talked about not sustaining this level of gross margin in Q2, because of our promotional activities upcoming. So all I can say is that after all that this is the guidance that we arrived at.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - BB&T Securities LLC
Okay. It was probably a poorly worded question, I put you on the spot, so I apologize. Let's try a different one that's easier. Let's try a softball.
Okay, long gun, up dramatically. This is the biggest – one of the biggest at least in the last 18 months that I've seen on your long gun rebound. Is that sustainable and in your projections or your guidance, excuse me, do you anticipate it to be sustainable at these levels?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I think that you have to just dial back a year ago and talk about inventory, again, when you think about MSRs. So there was very little MSR sales, because there was a high level of inventory at wholesale and retail. And as I talked about the last four earnings calls slowly that inventory correction has been taking place and we think that was complete some months ago, that has definitely helped our sales of MSRs in the consumer channel.
And then looking at the other component of our growth in long guns is about our Thompson/Center hunting brand. We're very excited about some of the products that we've been selling here, in particular, Venture bolt-action rifle. We're very excited about the growth potential in the hunting part of the firearms market. And we have some new products to target taking market share in the coming years.
So your question about sustainability, I'd come back to we've already said we're going to grow our company. We want to be the number one in market share in each major product category. We're going to grow by taking market share.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - BB&T Securities LLC
Okay. And then the promotional activity – promotional discounting that you're doing, given the dramatic rise in NICS data, why continue the promotional activity? Won't demand meet your new prices? Won't prices eventually rise with the huge surge in demand?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Because we want to take market share.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - BB&T Securities LLC
Fair enough. And are you trying to take it at all levels? Are you trying to enter – it sounds like some of these new – the products that you mentioned, many of those were at kind of the lower end of the price range of firearms, is that correct?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sorry, say that again, Brian?
Brian W. Ruttenbur - BB&T Securities LLC
Okay. So some of the new products that you're talking about seem to be priced at the more aggressive or the lower end of the firearms price range? Is that correct?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I don't believe we said that. No.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - BB&T Securities LLC
Okay. Is that the case? Are you trying to go after the low end? Or you still...?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We haven't given that detail. I haven't even told you what the new product is yet, so I can't give you the price. Yeah.
Brian W. Ruttenbur - BB&T Securities LLC
Fair enough. Well, thank you guys very much. I appreciate you taking my questions.
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
All right. Thanks, Brian.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Krueger with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Chris Krueger - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. All, but one of my questions has been answered. Just was wondering if you guys could provide any sort of update on the Army contract opportunity?
P. James Debney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Very little to update on there, I'm afraid. As I said earlier, it really is a waiting game, waiting for the RFP to come out. We believe we pretty much know that it's in its final, final review stage, so that's a good thing. We're excited about it. The partnership with General Dynamics is going really well. Our two teams are working very well together. So it's all good things. But again, we just don't know when the RFP will come out. But as I've always said, very strongly positioned with the handgun that we have to offer, our M&P polymer pistol, which will be the latest generation.
Chris Krueger - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you.

Operator, just one minute.
Jeffrey D. Buchanan - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer
Yeah, this is Jeff. I just wanted to add something to a question that Brian had asked about the rest of the year. I didn't mention that OpEx is going up. We did have $1.8 million benefit in this quarter because of an insurance recovery, and we also plan on spending more in OpEx, especially in sales and marketing, advertising, et cetera, so that's just another reason with regard to our current forecast.

Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report excellent second quarter results for ULTA Beauty, with strong sales momentum and better than expected earnings growth.
To recap the headlines, sales grew 19.4% and we achieved a 10.1% total company comp on top of a 9.6% comp in the second quarter of 2014. Transaction growth accounted for about two-thirds of our comp, with average ticket growth contributing about a third.
We continued to gain market share across all of our categories, with both Prestige and Mass Color Cosmetics achieving the strongest growth. Each of our businesses contributed healthy comp sales: an 8.8% comp in Retail, a 10.1% comp in Salon, and 43.4% growth in e-commerce. Earnings per share increased 22% to $1.15 compared to $0.94 in the second quarter of last year.
Scott will share the details of our second quarter results in a few minutes, but first I'd like to provide our quarterly business update through the lens of our six strategic imperatives, the framework we're using to drive sustainable sales and earnings growth and long-term shareholder value. The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests.
Our loyalty team is driving great performance through the critical Ultamate Rewards platform, which drives well over 80% of our sales. We now have 16.1 million active members, up 18% over the prior 12-month period. Our store associates are doing a fantastic job converting guests to loyalty members, and they achieved a significant increase in conversion leading to an acceleration in new member growth. Member retention rate increased, and we continue to see higher frequency of purchases, higher average ticket and higher average sales per member.
As part of our efforts to increase awareness of and clarity about the ULTA Beauty brand, we've relaunched our brand communications across all touch points to create an integrated message and consistent visual look and feel that positions ULTA Beauty as delivering the fun side of beauty. We believe this work sharpens and differentiates ULTA Beauty in the marketplace, and shapes our brand equity through a coordinated approach across all of our marketing vehicles, including advertising, e-mails, Ultamate Rewards materials, website and mobile apps, digital ads, store signage, social media and customer magazines.
Based on our successful 2014 test market, our plan is to include national television advertising to support our upcoming 21 Days of Beauty next month as well as again for the important holiday season. This national television advertising campaign marks the first in ULTA Beauty's history, an important step towards driving a strong and sustainable brand position while increasing awareness among beauty enthusiasts and driving new guest acquisitions.
The second strategic imperative is to differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. We continue to make progress here with in-store technology, associate training, and evolving the labor model to increase guest-facing time. And we've also had some nice wins enhancing personalization through our marketing tools. Let me give you a few examples.
As we continue to improve our ability to personalize our e-mails and make them more relevant to our guests, we're seeing very positive results. By leveraging insights about customer preferences and behaviors, we're able to tailor our communication to be more targeted and more motivating to our guests. During the second quarter, sales per e-mail delivered increased significantly year-over- as a result of this approach.
We launched personalized display ads in the second quarter to better target ads that are relevant to customer attributes and shopping behavior, moving away from predominantly static ad formats towards more dynamic ad formats. In addition, we're leveraging offline and online customer insights to make our online advertising more effective.
Now turning to Ultamate Rewards loyalty program, we continue to reward our best guests with a differentiated experience, driving increased engagement and satisfaction. In the second quarter, our Platinum members, our guests who spend more than $400 with ULTA Beauty during the year, received many perks including Platinum-only beauty steals, Platinum bonus points offers, early access to new products, a Platinum social contest, free shipping offers and targeted surprise and delight gifts.
Now moving to the third strategic imperative which is to offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. News and innovation was strong in the second quarter, and Prestige color cosmetics remained our best comping category. Sales growth was driven by newness across the board, including innovative foundations from Too Faced and Smashbox, Urban Decay's matte lipsticks and the excited Naked Smoky Palette as well as continued rapid growth in IT Cosmetics and IT Brushes for ULTA.
The contouring trend is still going strong, and the newer trend for strobing, or highlighting, drove comps in contouring kits and highlighters with newness from Anastasia, Lorac, Laura Geller and Tarte among the best performers.
We continue to roll out Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques, and all these brands executed very strong product launches such as Benefit's Roller Lash mascara, Clinique's Pop Lip Colour + Primer and Lancôme's Cushion Compact foundation. In addition, we're planning on expanding our Lancôme presence by launching five of their best-selling items into every store, not just those with Lancôme boutiques, starting next week. This full chain expansion is a further demonstration that our business model is successfully driving incremental growth for key brand partners.
Mass cosmetics continues to grow as well, performing well above industry growth rates. NYX, Maybelline and L'Oréal were growth standouts driven by newness and innovation. We also introduced two popular Indie Brands from the U.K., Makeup Revolution and Catrice, into our Mass cosmetics assortments on Ulta.com and in a limited number of stores.
The Mass category was also helped by solid growth in private label. We reset the ULTA Beauty collection in more than 300 stores at the end of the quarter with enhanced presentation as well as new formulations. The wall presentation is updated with color shelf strips and textured tile graphics, making it easier to shop as well as more efficient for our associates to stock the fixtures. We also introduced a fresh series of ULTA Beauty Kits offering great value and products that leverage current trends, including contouring, primers and brows.
The haircare category was also a big focus for us in the second quarter. We kicked off the quarter with our Love Your Hair Event in May, featuring Daily Beauty Steals, in-store events and live chats. July was headlined by our leader event featuring great deals on jumbo sizes of hair care products across all categories and brands. We also executed an extensive reflow of our Pro Hair planogram at the end of the first quarter, which refreshed our assortment and introduced clear, solutions-based signage to improve the guest experience. We believe this helped to set the stage for the most successful leader events in our history.
Our merchants, inventory and store operations teams work closely together to ensure strong execution and in-stock levels throughout the event. And this drove significant acceleration in the growth of core brands like Redken. This is a great example of how we can optimize growth on existing brands through a combination of guest insights, brand partnering and strong internal collaboration.
Other second quarter brand launches included several fragrance introductions, Sam Villa hair care appliances and Pacifica skin care products.
Next, our fourth strategic imperative, which is to deliver exceptional services in three core areas: hair, skin health and brows. Our Salon business continued to grow nicely, achieving total sales growth of 19.7% and comp growth of 10.1% as we continued to improve our offerings and sharpen our messages to our guests.
Top growth categories were haircuts and color, blow outs and make up services. Our comp was driven by about two-thirds guest comp growth and about a third by average ticket. Particular strength in new guest acquisition was driven by online bookings and CRM campaigns with targeted offers for first-time guests. We continue to attract new guests by offering services like blow outs and quick skin services. Promotions included offers to get the perfect blow out, special events featuring Living Proof's Perfect Hair Day products, and 25% off our 20-minute Dermalogica microderm skin treatments for first-time salon guests, all very successful.
During the second quarter we also trained all of our salon associates on the new fall and winter trends which were developed in partnership with Redken and renowned stylist Rodney Cutler, and supported by high quality training materials which integrate new styles for haircuts and colors with makeup trends for the very first time. This included product recommendations and technical instructions for how to get the various styles. And I'm sure you might be wondering what some of those might be. So a couple of examples: tortoise-shell hair with a suede eye and a rose blonde look with a petrol eye. Now these enhanced training sessions were very well received by our salon associates. We're now presenting these looks and trends in our integrated marketing plans across all associate and guest touch points.
Turning to our fifth strategic imperative: to grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. We opened 20 stores during the quarter, ending the second quarter with 817 stores. New store productivity continues to be very strong for the class of 2015 new stores, which are comfortably exceeding their sales plan. We remain on track to open approximately 100 net new stores this year with plans to open 44 stores in the third quarter and about 15 stores in the fourth quarter. The real estate pipeline for 2016 looks very good as well, and we've already approved a significant number of sites for next year's store growth plan. The two 5,000-square-foot rural stores, which we opened last fall, continue to perform very well. We're encouraged by the results, and we're still gaining insights on operating a smaller box efficiently.
We intend to open more of these small stores when we have the systems in place to make this format more scalable. Meanwhile, we've opened several stores in smaller than average markets with our 10,000-square-foot format that are exceeding expectations like our new store in Pikeville, Kentucky. So we're very confident that rural markets represent a significant and incremental opportunity for our store-opening program. Insights from operating smaller format stores will also benefit us as we look ahead to urban and other market opportunities.
On the e-commerce side, Ulta.com continues its rapid growth with sales up 43.4%, contributing 120 basis points of the total company comp of 10.1%. The Ulta.com and loyalty teams continue to see excellent results from implementing more targeted digital marketing strategies to drive traffic to the site and guests insights to drive trial offers and incremental purchases. Sampling is a key driver of growth at Ulta.com. Along with our brand partners, we've had strong success with our signature online offers, such as our monthly beauty bags with deluxe size samples and limited-time beauty steals that drive awareness in trial. Our beauty-enthusiast guests love these offers, and brand partners also enjoy working with us through our CRM platform to get their samples to the right targeted segments of our customer base. We continue to explore other areas to drive trial and discovery as well.
The website has been re-branded to incorporate the new elements of the brand, personality and color palette, and guests have responded very positively to these changes to the online experience. We also continue to benefit from new brands that we've added to our website, including Lancôme, Redken, Matrix, Pureology and It's a 10.
And finally, we have much to report on our sixth strategic imperative, to invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth, and capture scale efficiencies. We celebrated the grand opening of our Greenwood, Indiana distribution center on August 3, and we started to fulfill a small number of stores and e-commerce orders. We launched with six stores, and we're now gradually ramping up this facility, which is operating on a completely different model from our existing DCs and includes all-new systems and material handling equipment.
While it's still early, we're delighted that the DC is off to a smooth start, the culmination of two years of hard work and collaboration across supply chain, IT, stores and the e-commerce teams. Now this DC will ultimately ramp to service 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders when it reaches its full capacity over the next few years.
In addition to a more efficient operating model within the distribution centers, our stores will receive fewer, fuller and more stable cartons. Shipments will feature greater categorization, which makes it easier for our store associates to get product from carton to shelf, freeing up labor hours for customer-facing activities rather than tasking.
So we're also implementing a number of core merchandising systems and tools to drive productivity as part of the overall supply chain initiative. For example, this fall we'll launch a product information management system that integrates vendor information into ULTA Beauty systems and aligns product information across all channels to improve data governance.
We also plan to roll out a vendor scorecard to collaborate with our brand partners to drive improvements in performance, such as improved inbound lead time consistency leading to better in-stock levels and an improved guest experience.
We'll also start to roll out our demand forecasting and inventory optimization tool, which provides forecasting and replenishment models to improve supply chain capabilities. This tool will help us drive higher sales and less clearance and improve vendor fill rates as well as lead to better in-store presentation and higher in-stock levels. We plan to launch one category this fall then roll-out the system to all categories next year.
And finally, we're on track to open up our fifth distribution center in Dallas next summer, and all the merchandising systems and tools that we're in the process of implementing will work together to support our growth plans and improve the guest and associate experience. In the aggregate these new distribution centers, projects and systems are expected to drive significant long-term efficiencies to optimize our supply chain for product source to guests, and help us deliver the financial results we've committed to in our five-year plan.
That wraps up my update on the strategic imperatives, and now I'll hand it over to Scott.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter sales were $877 million compared to $734 million last year, an increase of 19.4%. Comparable sales increased 10.1%. The retail comp was 8.8%, the salon-only comp was 10.1% and ecommerce growth was 43.4%. The total company comp was driven primarily by traffic strength, with transactions up 7% and ticket up 3.1%. Similar to the trend we've seen for the past few quarters, ticket was driven by higher average selling price as a result of strong sales in Prestige categories and less reliance on broad discounting. Retail-only comparable transactions were very healthy, up 6.3%, even stronger than what we achieved in the first quarter.
Ecommerce growth was driven primarily by traffic, but average ticket also increased. Gross profit dollars were up 18.2% to $306.5 million, but gross profit margin deleveraged 40 basis points to 34.9% from 35.3% last year. Gross profit benefited from improvement in product margins due to higher mix of Prestige products, offering a more complete assortment on Ulta.com, and less discounting overall. These benefits, however, were offset by planned supply chain investments including the startup of our new distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana.
SG&A expense increased 16.6% to $183.9 million, down 50 basis points as a percentage of sales to 21% versus 21.5% last year. The key driver of this improvement was marketing expense leverage, partly due to stronger-than-expected sales, but also as a result of concentrating more of our marketing expense later in the year. We still plan to keep marketing as a percentage of sales flat for the full year, since we will be ramping up our marketing spend in the second half to drive brand awareness through national television and radio campaign.
Pre-opening expense was $4.1 million compared to $3.6 million last year, driven by 20 store openings, one relocation and two remodels during the quarter compared to 19 new stores opened and four remodels completed during Q2 2014. Operating income increased 20.9% to $118.5 million. Operating margin was up 20 basis points versus last year to 13.5%.
Our tax rate was 37.5% versus 38.1% last year, driven primarily by the impact of accounting for equity compensation transactions. Net income increased 22% to $74.2 million or $1.15 per diluted share versus $60.8 million or $0.94 per diluted share last year.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventories were $705.7 million at the end of the quarter compared to $541.5 million at the end of Q2 2014, up 14% on a per-store basis. Excluding the investment in inventory to stock the new DC in Greenwood, inventory per door was up 10.9%, roughly in line with our comp growth. This increase was related to maintaining strong in-stock levels for our fastest-turning SKUs to support our rapid sales growth, the addition of new brands and the rollout of Clinique and Lancôme boutiques.
Capital expenditures were $80.6 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, merchandise fixtures and supply chain and system investments. We are on track to spend about $300 million in CapEx this year.
Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter were $39 million, and are expected to be about $170 million for the full year. We ended Q2 with $475 million of cash and short-term investments.
The company repurchased approximately 291,000 shares at a cost of $46 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan as part of our program to return cash to shareholders. As of the end of the quarter $286 million remained available under the $400 million share repurchase program. We expect to continue to offset dilution with our 10b5-1 plan and still have the flexibility to repurchase opportunistically beyond that.
Turning now to guidance for 2015, in terms of our outlook for the full year, based on our strong performance in the first half, we are raising our sales and earnings expectations for the year. We expect to open approximately 100 stores in 2015 and remodel four stores. We plan to grow e-commerce sales in the 40% range. We expect to drive comparable sales in the 8% to 10% range. We expect to deliver earnings per share growth in the high-teens, from the $3.96 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2014, which excludes the $0.02 non-recurring tax benefit in Q4 of last year. This guidance includes planned supply chain and systems investments, and assumes we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution.
We expect to de-leverage on the gross profit line and modest leverage on the SG&A line, and operating margin is expected to be about flat. As a reminder, much of the investment related to our supply chain project will hit gross profit, including higher depreciation expense, which you'll really begin to see in the third quarter. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 38%. We expect to spend capital on a $300 million range and to generate free cash flow similar to last year's performance. We're very pleased to raise our annual comp guidance and earnings outlook to deliver high teens earnings growth while making significant investments in the business to drive sustainable, long-term market share gains and shareholder value.
Moving on to specific guidance for the third quarter; we expect sales to be in the range of $869 million to $883 million compared to $745.7 million last year. We anticipate achieving comparable sales in the range of 8% to 10% versus 9.5% last year. We expect to open 44 stores in the third quarter versus 50 stores opened in Q3 last year, so pre-opening expense should expected to be down slightly. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.05 versus $0.91 for Q3 last year. We anticipate a tax rate of 36.9% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.2 million. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator?

Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions for you. Mary, if you could just start with some of the new brand initiatives. We've seen some of the roll-outs in stores as well as some of your digital communication. Can you talk about some successes there and how you're thinking about strategically deploying those across some new initiatives for the back half? And then just a question on the DC; could you remind us, once that DC is fully up and running, what the total store capacity will be of your existing infrastructure and when you may need to invest again to support the next roll-out of some of the smaller format stores? Thank you.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, let me just say that the newness that you asked about, I think it's really – we constantly know that our guests are interested in news and innovation. And as I mentioned, there's several things that were quite successful in the quarter. So brands like Benefit and Urban Decay with a smoky palette, brands like Anastasia, across all categories, Redken Frizz Dismiss, Mix is a hot brand. So there was really a lot of newness as well as existing brand newness, new brands and just core brand growth. And how that works in terms of our platforms in terms of marketing is that's really where we bring it all together is just making sure that our guests get to understand what we have that's new and exciting. I think our marketing tactics are breaking through the herd in even better ways all the time. So that's going to be a core part of what we do, and I think we're getting better at it all the time, more efficient and more effective.
In terms of distribution centers, so, this new DC will serve the 400 stores, 45,000 ecommerce orders. We're planning another distribution center that's in development, in construction right now in Dallas that will open next year. And that will be sufficient for the capacity that we need for some period of time. We'll continue to evaluate that. Whether it's small or large stores, we would anticipate that to be covered in the network that we're defining. But certainly that's fluid as we continue to grow and look out to the future; we'll continue to evolve that strategy and our needs.

Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.
Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC
Congratulations on really spectacular growth here. Regarding the holiday plans and inventory optimization, which categories are most ripe for that process and will that impact holiday? And some retailers are potentially, in different categories are potentially over-inventoried in the marketplace, so how should we think about the main catalyst for you in holiday at large and what might be most different on a year-over-year basis?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, thank you, Oliver. I'd say broadly speaking of course holiday we've been focused on for months. We're excited about it. It's clearly something that is important to us and to our guests as well. I guess what I would say is that we just try to be clear about making sure that we've got adequate inventory for what we expect to be our top volume items. And we think we're in good position to do that. So I would say that that we look at that as a core part of how we do business. Given our growth trends, and I think our ability to really understand what's going to move, we don't have big concerns about things that don't work during holiday, I think historically we've been able to manage that really well and have a low amount of products that don't work well. But, so I think we're in good shape there. Is there anything you'd want to add to that, Scott?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
No, I would just add that really we don't have any concerns about our inventory position. Again, very little in the way of seasonality and what we carry in our stores. I think we probably have one of the best-in-class in retail as far as the ability to work through discontinued product or clearance things and partnering with our brand vendors to do that in the most profitable way possible.
Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the mobile front, is there any – where are you in the innings of like innovation there, and what are the next chapters for us to look forward to as this customer seems really engaged on the mobile frontier as well?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
And I'll let Dave take that.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Yeah, that's great, Oliver. Yeah, mobile obviously is continuing to grow for us and for – it's increasingly the way consumers want to engage with brands and shop. For us in the second quarter, about 60% of our traffic came through our mobile applications, mobile website, and about 25% of our sales. So it's, we're well past the early innings on the impact that it's having in the marketplace, and we're continuing to optimize the experience in our total digital footprint, which mobile is a critical one. We're improving our app pretty significantly and trying to make that shopping experience easier when she's on our mobile website. All of the changes that we're making around trying to increase conversion and increase average order, that we're doing both on the desktop service as well as mobile are having an impact.
So we're trying to sharpen how the offers that we're highlighting, the way we can personalize e-mails that then drive her to the mobile website. So a lot that we're doing we think it will increase, continue to increase. It's clearly the way that she wants to shop and it's a big area of focus for us going forward.

The next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.
Good afternoon. I'll echo the terrific results. Just a little more color, if I could. In a general trend within retail and omni-channel, retailers obviously, e-commerce sales and sometimes coming at the expense of the in-store business; clearly that does not seem to be happening with you guys seeing actually an uptick. Just curious what you feel like – you talked about marketing. Are there any, a couple of things that you feel like are incrementally resonating even a little bit more with the consumer? And then lastly, I'll just editorialize I'm assuming that the Donald Trump look is not one of the fall and winter looks that you guys are considering?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
We took that one off the table. That's funny. On the e-commerce omni-channel, let me just start broadly and then maybe I'll ask Dave to add some specifics. But I think a couple of things. One is that we're clear that for us, two things, one is that the multi-channel shopper is our best shopper. She's driving a lot. It's really a pretty incremental business for us. And the core insight is that the experience to go shop for beauty is one that largely women want to have happen in the physical bricks and mortar space. In our play, what we're trying to do is make the store experience just so inviting with the right products and the right level of service across the board, and we think that's working for us and is very sustainable.
She likes to come and explore and to try and to spend time there with services as well. Obviously, that's something you can't get done online. So for us, we see that as the core part of our business; e-commerce is working in a way that kind of neat because it's incremental. So the shoppers that we have that are shopping both online and in store are by far our best shoppers. They're, for example, maybe coming nine times a year versus store-only, which is like four times a year. That's only a small percentage of our guests that are actually doing that, so we like that. We think growth in e-commerce, obviously, is going to be incremental and profitable for us and fits with the consumer insight and the model that we're building.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
I'll just to add to that, certainly, we look at total omni-channel customers, the one that we're most focused on continuing to grow. And so most of the marketing efforts that we're doing are driving both online and in-store activity. So that Mary mentioned some of the advertising programs in the second quarter, a fair amount of radio advertising, enhanced digital advertising, both of which through our analysis drives both in-store and online activities. Certainly, within the digital space itself, our social media activity has increased quite a bit. Our PR is much stronger. We're doing more with social influencers to drive greater engagement. And then, as we roll, as Mary mentioned, roll into the third quarter beyond into other tactics that we historically haven't used like TV. We think all of those will contribute to driving a more loyal guest. She is very attracted to our loyalty program. And that behavior then gets her shopping in both channels, and that's the behavior that we want to continue to drive. And we've had some success doing that so far.
Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.

Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats. Sorry if I missed it, within the traffic increase, can you share the breakdown between new customers versus increased frequency of existing shoppers? And then maybe can you talk about where you're still sourcing those customers from? And then just, Scott, given the moving pieces, can you help with the magnitude of the gross margin impacts over the next several quarters? Thanks.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I guess I'll start. We don't really break out new customers versus existing. I mean we bifurcate the top; we talked about the fact that the majority of the comp, two-thirds of it was transaction or traffic based with the remainder being average ticket, and that was primarily driven by average selling price. So units were relatively flat year-over-year, more Prestige again, less promotion, which is driving the basket increase overall.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
I'd say we are excited; we're really pleased with both, though, our new traffic, our new guest acquisition rate. Mary in her comments mentioned that our membership grew to 16 million guests or about 18%, and that was driven by healthy increases in new guests as well as strong retention, increase in retention of the existing guests. So we feel like we're both attracting new and then keeping even more of our existing guests engaged in our proposition.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
And a little color specific to 2Q as far as margin goes, we're very happy to see core product margins in our retail business, which again is more than 90% of our total sales, continue to expand. Prestige mix helped, less promotion overall helped. We did have a little bit of headwind; we didn't have as much fixed store leverage in the second quarter is what we saw earlier in the year or what we saw in a year-ago period. We also had a litany of other smaller items that affected the quarter; again we normally don't get into this level of detail, but salon for example, we mentioned in the script, Mary did, about some training for our salon associates for the fall trend look. We pulled forward some expenses there, so that was a bit more of a headwind than what we expected. And we also had the startup of the DC, which negatively affected gross profit in the quarter.
Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Great. Thanks a lot. Best of luck for the rest of the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Erica A. Eiler - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good afternoon. This is Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Congrats on the really – another nice quarter. So I just want to get back to e-commerce here, I mean it sounds like you've clearly done a lot to enhance the customer experience online. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from consumer purchases online, specifically maybe what the Mass/Prestige mix of products looks like online versus in stores? And then also just wondering if perhaps consumers are buying more staple-like products, maybe their foundations or go-to mascaras versus maybe shaded goods or skincare products that consumers may want to experiment with in stores? That would be great. Thanks.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Yeah. Great questions. Again we're very pleased with our overall e-commerce success, and we see a lot of runway going forward. Specifically, some of the questions, we don't really break down between categories, but what I would – your question about Mass versus Prestige what I would say is that the – a key part of our total proposition, e-commerce, anywhere, in our brick-and-mortar and e-commerce stores is All Things Beauty, All in One Place, the breadth of assortment, the breadth of price points, the breadth of categories, that certainly is what drives our business and differentiates us and we see that within the e-commerce space.
So largely I'd say the assortment and the engagement that we have in our brick-and-mortar stores is largely reflected on e-commerce. There were some categories in e-commerce that we've talked about in the past that we didn't have as full an assortment, but much of that gap has been closed, largely in our professional hair care. So we see that really reflecting what we see in the in-store environment.
For staples versus trying new things, I'd say it's a bit of both. We certainly don't see only staple or replenishment-type items being bought online. That is happening, but what we find, particularly with those guests that are, that we talked about that are omni-channel guests that are really our best guests, she's shopping more frequently in total across both our retail stores and our e-commerce site and she's buying items that, yes, she can – maybe that are replenishment, but she's also indulging in things that she hasn't tried that are new items. She wants to get a purse; she wants to go online right when new offers are up and available. So she's doing a bit of both, and that's absolutely the types of things that we're encouraging. We'll find it, make it easier for her going forward to replenish those favorite items, but also continue to highlight news and exclusive and first-to-market items that get her excited when they come out.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, and I'll just add, and I mentioned this in the script, our CRM capability gives us the ability to really get – to experiment a lot with how to get more personalized and more customized on what we e-mail, to whom, and really allow her to try things whether it's Beauty Breaks or just e-mail that introduce her to new products. So it's really a nice way for our guests to learn about new products and try new categories that they wouldn't have before.

Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks. Nice results. Mary, you mentioned evolving labor model in your prepared remarks. Can you update us on your thoughts there? I think at Analyst Day, you suggested you might experiment in some areas in the labor model. And then connected to it, you're being very successful with CRM and marketing. Curious in places where you're testing increased labor if you're seeing a benefit above and beyond some of the success you're seeing with CRM and targeting?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Simeon. Just stepping back, let me just kind of big picture-wise I guess what I would say is that as we think about it, Kecia Steelman, who's our Head of Store Operations and her leadership team, we've got a very experienced set of store operators, and we're really focused on continuous improvement and excellence in operations and guest service kind of across the board. So while the payroll test is kind of a piece of it, just to give you a broader perspective, I mean, we're really kind of thinking about how do you put the guests and the associates serving the guests in the center of kind of everything we do, and really a holistic approach to – improvements, whether it's people, processes or tools. So that's everything from identifying the right talent, training and development, store processes, best use of labor hours as we kind of talked about there, all to kind of just really improve that guest experience.
So the payroll test is just a part of it. We're learning things. We've extended it to another 60 stores. We've gotten some specific learnings, things that we're trying that are differently. I don't want to get more specific on it than that because we're still learning, but certainly, we're measuring impact on sales and units per transaction and whatnot. It's kind of a combination of art and science. It'll be core to just what we do all the time. So there's no big kind of aha in one specific thing coming out of it, but think about it as just a piece of a broader focus on how do we get better every day, and what we do in store to serve our guests.

Next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI
Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on the inventory. When we look at that 30% inventory growth you had, I think you said 16% of that was related to getting a DC in stock, and I assume some of that would be safety stocks. I wonder what the, of that 16%, how much is in stock versus safety stock? And does that normalize over the year, or do we really need to get past the DC that opens in 2016 to see those growth rates drop? And the second one is on advertising. With the testing you were doing last year, I know you were happy with those tests, and you expressed how good they were in the test-market stratagem. So my question is as you didn't do as much advertising in the second quarter, did those markets where you did the tests in continue to outperform the rest of the company or the company average?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I'll start with that. I'm not, I wouldn't want to comment about kind of all the specific learnings. Clearly, we feel good about what we've learned, and it's been, we've been I guess modifying our marketing mix for some period of time, with Dave's leadership and his team. So what I'm excited about is that our marketing is getting more efficient and effective every day. And that's really critical for us through the long term to drive short-term results and to create a long-term, strong brand and brand equity. So that like, I'd say in the last quarter, seeing we added radio advertising. We did a lot of PR. We did a lot of digital. We also continued tactics that we've always done like tabs and magazines. All of those are getting more effective and efficient with less reliance on discounting.
In addition now, as I mentioned, next, this really starting next month, we're going to layer in national television advertising. We learned from the in-store tests that that was going to be effective for us, and so we're going to add that to the mix. So just I guess I feel confident in saying that we got a lot of good learnings out of the tests, and now we're moving forward, implementing all those learnings as we go. But again, it's art and science. So this won't – there's never actually one answer and it's never any one stopping point, right. We'll continue to evolve as we go.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
And with respect to the inventory, it was roughly $20 million at the end of the quarter which I'd say is all safety stock because we weren't servicing any stores out of that DC at that point in time, right. We started subsequent to quarter-end, so I would say we expect that to be kind of the high watermark on a per door basis for fiscal 2015. We expect to see some moderation now the second half of the year, and should stay roughly in that zone as we cycle through next year with another DC stacked on top. So once we get through 2016, again with all of the systems we're putting in place: the DC, forecasting, replenishment, other floor planning kinds of tools; we expect all of those to help contribute to improved inventory flows and improved turns.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Good evening. So wanted to follow up on the gross margin question; how significant was the DC start-up costs and the 50 bps? And would you consider it one-time? And then on a related note, can you provide some color on the magnitude of the marketing shift out of 2Q? And whether those dollars spread roughly equally in the back half?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I guess with respect to the gross margin, I'm not going to quantify the basis points here. We try to steer away from specific P&L line guidance. But it's going to be much more significant in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter, okay, so just directionally second quarter, a lot of payroll costs, right. We've got rent expense running through the P&L because we're in start-up mode, but the depreciation doesn't really start and that's really going to be the significant incremental cost, run it through the gross profit line starting in the third quarter, all right, for all the investment. And again, we called that out in our investor communications, right, it's upwards of $60 million, so it is a significant step-up from what we've done historically.
Marketing, kind of along the same lines, we're not trying to get too specific on what dollars moved where, but it's significant. I mean we saw some in the first quarter, we called that out. We saw more in the second quarter. And again, it's a result of us being smarter during the quarter. We're seeing sales trends, and if we see an opportunity to pull back we will do that. And we'll keep the dry powder for when the ducks are flying, so to speak. So fourth quarter there's a lot of shopping, a lot of new guests coming into a lot of new stores that we're opening during the course of the year, and we're going to deploy the marketing where we think it makes the most sense.
Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And then – and just going back to the gross margin question, so understood, the depreciation steps up but you don't necessarily have the other items sitting in there like the Salon training which would pressure gross margin. I guess what I'm trying to understand is could gross margin in the back half be down in similar magnitude as it was in the second quarter?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
I don't think I want to get to that level of detail. Again, I would just say though there's always, every quarter is kind of standalone. There's ins and there's outs. The Salon we mentioned this time because that was a bit of an unusual item; e-commerce was strong, right, that Leader Event (47:38) that's another one-off, it was stronger than we thought it was going to be online which was great. They were incremental sales, but we had additional freights costs there, right, it's heavier product, it costs a little bit more to ship. So it's not – we don't think it's productive to get into reconciling the basis points every quarter.
But one thing I would point out is if you're looking at next year, we got a new distribution center coming online next year, right, where we're going to have a lot of these start-up costs and the same. So I wouldn't expect it to create the same level of headwinds just because you're kind of lapping a big event like that this year, but it will be additional headwind next year.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just first question, I just want to go back to the inventory line for a second, I think Scott, you mentioned earlier obviously that that's going to remain a bit elevated here with the new DC coming online. When do you expect the year-over-year increase in per door inventories to migrate back to basically same-store sales growth? Is that next year?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
Well, I'd say we're going to be in the neighborhood this year. I mean look at the comp that we're posting, it's an 11% comp so you're looking at ex that $20 million of start-up inventory I'd call it, we're at the comp level. So it's not – I wouldn't view the inventory as being out of control in any way, shape or form. I mean we feel very comfortable with the inventory that we have. Again, there's little seasonal or fashion risk to the inventory. I mean to be frank, we spend most of our time trying to figure out how to stay ahead of the trend usually when we're chasing inventory.
So with the cash and the balance sheet strength we have, we're not going to be shy about making some bets going into the fourth quarter, right, on hot products. So we're – I would say generally speaking there's nothing to see here, right. We're very comfortable with our inventory position.
Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's good to hear. And then secondly in terms of your decision to go into national TV advertising for the first time, why now? Is this something that you view as a natural extension of your marketing strategy? Was it something that was sort of debated internally? Or was this just an obvious move on your part? Thanks.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. It's really been part of our thinking all along, and really part of our five-year plan. The first strategic imperative that we described is driving new guest acquisition and more loyal – more sales from our current guests. We know that we have a gap in awareness of our brand relative to our competitors, whether it's aided or unaided. And there's – television advertising is one of the tools, one of the fastest tools to drive awareness. And we've been two years into it now. So it wasn't like we're just going to go and jump and do that overnight. We carefully developed brand positioning, created, tested it, tested the media plan, so feel confident that the time is right.
Also I would say we all know it's a very competitive marketplace. It's always been and probably always will be. So striking while the iron's hot I guess. We're in a position to build a long-term sustainable business model here. And we think this is a key part of it is to really keep pressing ahead with the marketing tools to drive both short-term and long-term results. And we feel it's the right time to do it. We're ready to do it.

Okay. Next question comes from the line of Kelly Halsor from Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.
Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Hi. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on another great quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Prestige skin care category. It's been a few quarters since you guys have called it out as a top performing category. So what are you seeing in terms of trends and newness of products and brands beyond the rollout of the branded boutiques? Are there any opportunities to add new brands, especially in light of some of the well-known brands recently announcing plans again to do specialty multichannel in a bigger way? And then secondly, could you provide any more color around the cadence of the DC and the store ramp-up? How many stores do you need to get to start to see some leverage on costs associated with that facility? And just any timing around that would be helpful as well. So thanks.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
I'll start with the Prestige skin care. Prestige skin care I think is probably aware is not – has been a little slower than historical over the last few years. It has slowed down as a category, although we see it as a critical central category to our overall proposition. And we're excited about the potential. I think it's a mix of great partners that we have in place today. Some of our biggest, strongest brands like Philosophy, Dermalogica, Clarisonic. Dermalogica with our partnership with Skin Services (52:28) is a key strategic platform for us. We continue to engage our guests and not only have her engage in products, but have her engage in services. So we see those largest brands continue to grow and provide opportunity both today in some of the innovation and pipeline that we know that they're going to drive going forward.
There are additional brands in our box that are relatively new or new or up and coming. A brand like Juice Beauty is a nice brand that we're excited about and that's performing quite well. There are, to your question, there are certainly additional brands that we don't carry today. I'm not going to talk about any of them specifically but there certainly are brands that we're continuing to explore. We have a full team dedicated to exploring, figuring out which ones would make most sense in our proposition and our box going forward. So we'll continue to add innovation in the skincare category. We see it as a mix. You're right that there's been some, a fair amount of, I guess consolidation, Unilever playing a bigger role in Prestige skincare. We think that's probably only good to get greater emphasis on the category, some new resources and we think it'll attract growth going forward.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
And, Kelly, the short answer on the leverage question on fixed costs there. We would expect, we expect to see benefits from the Greenwood facility, we expect to see some benefits next year. Of course those will be masked somewhat by adding another new DC in the Dallas area. Meaningfully 2017 I think is where we'd be able to see more presence of leverage on the P&L overall.

Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good afternoon, and great quarter. I have a bigger picture question. Mary, we've seen growth in popularity of these beauty subscription services. I think one of your competitors actually recently announced a launch in that area. Can you just give us your thoughts on the merits of that model? Is it something ULTA loyalty guests are asking for? Something you could see ULTA doing in the foreseeable future? And maybe any comment on where your capabilities lie there given the new DC investments. Thank you.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Yeah. I'll take that, Mark. We see the real benefit of that whole space as fundamentally driving trial and discovery of products for our guests. And that's something that we've been focused on for a while. We do a lot in that space. We do not currently offer an exact subscription-based model similar to some of the other ones that are out there. And we'll explore all our options going forward, although I'd say what we're really focused on is finding what we think are probably even better ways to drive that discovery and trial. We do a lot with our guests to provide products. We do programs through our e-commerce platform, Beauty Breaks, which are kind of weekly limited-time offers that give half prices and samples associated with it. We have Beauty Bags that are extremely popular that give premium size samples to our guests. And then we feel they're more targeted and more relevant.
We often partner those with buy-ins on certain products, so there's a – our customers are more engaged in it. They're expecting these products to come along with it, so their usage we think is really good. We're also experimenting in another variety of different ways again tried this (56:09) trial and discovery. For example, recently we had a program with a very popular YouTube blogger, created a sample bag with her favorite items that was exclusively sold through, or made available to her followers with a buy-in on our website. So we think it not only drove business, it drove engagement, it sampled products and discovery.
So the whole space around trial and discovery is one that we're – we think we're very active in. We've reached hundreds of thousands of guests with those kind of programs, and we'll continue to drive that kind of program going forward because it excites our guests, it gets them in, engaged in more and more of our products going forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.
Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations on the terrific results. As you think about the new guests that are coming in, whether going to the salon or even in the store with Prestige, do you think these salon guests, how many of them are coming from loyalty programs, how many of them are coming from the marketing efforts that you're putting into place, and what does this mean for conversion into loyalty members going forward? Thank you.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I'm glad you asked that because it's an exciting area for us in terms of growth, future growth, because really a small percentage of our loyalty guests today are using the salon. We're doing a lot. I'd say it's coming from a lot of things. One is we've offered a new online booking service that we know is driving largely incremental new guests, thousands of them, in fact.
And then also our marketing programs right now are getting more and more focused on integrating makeup and hair and trend, and they're very exciting. And I think, and we're actually bringing to our store associates this kind of trend training that we talked about, bringing it to life inside the store. And certainly every guest that comes into the – to an ULTA store who is a potential new loyalty member, our in-store – our associates in store are doing a great job of converting them into the loyalty program because they understand that that's important for the business. So all those items will work together we think and will continue to be a key part of our growth story.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. I'm sorry, Mike, did you have a question?
Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Sorry about that. I did the old mute thing. You guys talked about in your prepared remarks a metric of sales per e-mail sent out, which is an interesting metric. How long have you – can you give us some more color on that? How long have you measured that? Has the growth accelerated at all? Or what has that looked like in the past? Thanks.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Yeah. We won't get real – the specific numbers on it, but it is something that we've measured for a while, and we're seeing really, really healthy growth. And that growth in effectiveness of our e-mail campaigns is really fundamentally coming from I'd say two places. One is better targeting, so we're understanding our consumers' desires we think a little bit better, and personalizing the e-mails to them. And then, the offers, the items and the creative that surrounds them we think is better as well.
So the e-mails themselves are better, better items, better offers, better programs that are personalized in much sharper ways. And those things have really worked well. So we're sending out more e-mails, but we're getting much more effective and efficient in doing it, and we think it will be a big growth driver for us going forward.
Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. That makes sense. If I could ask one other, just on the supply chain; I assume we're still on line for that, the hit this year to be 5 percentage points relative to your earnings growth. And did that peak? It seems like that's going to peak probably around the third quarter. Is that right?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer
That's correct. You got that. Yeah. Third quarter when we flip the switch at the beginning of the third quarter and that's when it was right just doing a store or two, and now we're going to ramp it up, and it will get more efficient over time. And as we get into the fourth quarter it's going to service 130 stores, 140 stores. So at that point it will be more productive and be contributing more, or less drag overall I guess I should say.
Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC
Hello. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like we're in overtime here. A lot of retailers have struggled with trying to reduce promotions and still hold sales. You guys are one of the few where you've actually pulled back on promotions and sales have kind of held or accelerated. I know you are still using pretty blunt instruments when it comes to CRM and customer knowledge. I'm just wondering, is there potentially another round of that as you look at kind of the response that your customers have had to it. Do you think that if we, or you decided to kind of pull that lever again, that you might be able to go another round perhaps a bit more surgical, but kind of almost repeat that same exercise?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would say that – I don't know that I envision another big change here. This is a gradual process that we've been working on really for some period of time which is kind of the careful experimentation, testing and learning, trying things differently and changing such that our marketing mix now – I wouldn't say it's blunt instruments so much anymore. I mean I understand your question but I think we now have a really robust array of tools that are getting better and better as it relates to effectiveness and efficiency.
So I would just consider this a core part of how we're going to always do our business, which is constantly look for how can we be driving long-term brand equity, which is really important that people understand what ULTA is and they're aware of us, they understand that we are All Things Beauty, All in One Place. And then lots of surgical tools to drive the short-term day-to-day results that we need. So it's an ongoing piece of how we're going to do the business. Dave and his team are all over it. And that's how we look at it.
Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC
Let me ask it another way, is if you were to look at your level of promotion today versus the brand equity you think ULTA deserves or warrants, do you think those two are in balance now? Or are they still a little out of balance and which way?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, we're really just starting the national television advertising, as you know, so that's another kind of shift in the balance of the mix. I envision that we'll be able to hold our (1:03:00) ratio pretty consistent over time with the mix being – getting more in balance. But I'd say it's getting there gradually. It's not wildly out of balance. I think we're moving into a place that will be pretty sustainable for the long-term.
Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good luck with the new DC.

Godfrey Sullivan
Thanks, Kent. Hello, everyone. We had a great Q2 and I want to thank our customers and partners for their enthusiastic support and our Splunk employees for their many contributions.
Total revenues came in at a 148.3 million, up 46% over the last year. We’re delighted to welcome more than 500 new customers to the Splunk family and we now have more than 10,000 customers worldwide. The highlights of any Splunk quarter are always about our customer success. I was really happy to see some of you who attended our recent Splunk Live San Francisco, with our customer Sephora spoke about the challenges of deploying there in-store mobile point of sale systems. Splunk helped them failed customer transactions by 95%, increased customer satisfaction and doubled the revenue through their mobile point of sales systems, Sephora said, “Splunk has helped us to move from ambiguity to transparency. Also at San Francisco Aquanox explained how after deploying Splunk cloud as their security intelligence solution, they went from monitoring 20 billion raw events across multiple silos to just 20 daily actionable alerts, all through the correlations and analytics in our security app. You can check out these and other great customer presentations on our splunklive.com Web site. Our customers continue to create impressive new use cases and they also guide our investments into new solutions areas.
Moving on to products, we closed two acquisitions in Q2, Metafor Software and Caspida. Metafor provides anomaly detection and behavioral analytics for IT operations use cases. Caspida provide data science driven behavioral analytics for security use cases. This acquisition is in line with our strategy of expanding our cyber security offerings and will enable us to bring more advanced analytical capabilities to our customers.
We're pleased to welcome the Metafor and Caspida teams to Splunk. A remainder everyone on the call, our User Conference is coming up in September and our product teams will be making an impressive set of announcements, including the launch of our new solution for IT service intelligence and of course an exciting new release for Splunk Enterprise. I hope to see you there and we'll certainly be ready to celebrate with you.
On the call with me today, Doug will provide our field report, Haiyan will cover security markets and Marc Olesen will provide an update on our velocity in cloud. As always Dave Conte will mesmerize you with his financial updates. Let's go to Doug. 
Dave Conte
Thank you, Godfrey. I am really proud of our field organization for delivering another strong quarter and first half for the year. We're rapidly building our customer facing organizations to support four initiatives. First, we are concentrating our headcount expansion to major countries where we need critical mask to better support our customers.
During Q2, we had more than 100 global field positions. Second, we're aligning our field technical resources with our market groups to ensure that we can deliver a best in class customer experience in our core solutions areas. Third, we're investing in our customer success organization. This is a team that works with customers to drive ROI, value realization and expansion of this critical Splunk use cases.
Finally, with our channel partners, we're concentrating our focus and our economics to ensure that those who invest in Splunk capabilities see a higher return on their investment. Public sector is a great example, where we've invested heavily to create teams who are dedicated to federal, state and local government and a new team dedicated to higher education. Great examples of our work in public sector in Q2, include the United State Marine Corp who chose Splunk Enterprise as the anchor of their new IT operations and a federal agency who purchase Splunk Enterprise, ES and Hunk to correlate and analyze terabytes of data across multiple Hadoop environments. We add continued momentum in state, local arena as well. The state of Utah bought Splunk Enterprise and ES to identify suspicious event, our correlating data from firewalls, systems, devices and applications. And many other great wins including New Mexico human services, Pennsylvania development of transportation, Washington D.C. Health Benefit Exchange and the San Diego sheriff’s department.
I'm also really pleased about the acceleration of our new higher education team. In addition to how we more than 500 higher end customers, our software is now being taught or used for research at more than 100 universities. Stateside colleges like Georgetown, Northwestern, San Jose State and UC Boulder. Internationally, Singapore's Nanyang Polytechnic, Italy's Sapienza and UK's Oxford are among the campuses providing the workforce of the future with the way to learn Splunk skills reflecting the high demand that we see of these skills in our customer base.
As Scot Wheeler of Northwestern put it, students need to understand the power of combining unstructured [technical difficulty] with the structured data that businesses already collect and manage. Integrating Splunk solutions into our curriculum gives an access to a simple-to-use platform that can change the competitive stature of any business.
I also want to complement our America's team, who continued to lead with excellence. They had an impressive Q2, touting enterprise adoption agreements with multiple customers, including Staples for IT operations, application delivery and customer analytics. As a reminder our EAA program enables customers of any size to purchase unlimited licenses with fixed predictable costs. Other customer wins included Barnes & Noble for application delivery and Yelp, a new multi-care by customer for business analytics.
As we continue to ramp our international coverage, I'm pleased to announce customer wins including Samsung Semiconductor, a new customer in Internet of Things and Atlassian who saw the benefits of Splunk over prior open source initiatives and signed an unlimited EAA to standardize on Splunk.
I'll now like to call the few partners including Amazon who were retained to win cloud orders at Chicago Public Schools and Arlington County, Virginia and Kepware, one of our partners for IoT data who received an award for 2015 product of the year by IoT Evolution Magazine for their Industrial Data Forwarder for Splunk.
In summary, it was a great quarter. Healthy breath of orders, geographic diversity and Splunk continuing to become a platform that spans multiple departments supporting a wide variety of use cases. Our team also did a fantastic job in the cloud, where our ability to handle on-prem and cloud is a significant advantage. For more on that let me turn it over to Marc Olesen.
Marc Olesen
Thank Doug. Our Q2 results show continued acceleration in our cloud business. We tripled our orders in nine months. Our customers are excited with the speed and ease of Splunk Cloud. They are happy to focus their time and attention on analyzing the data to achieve their business results rather than procuring and deploying equipment. As a reminder, Splunk Cloud is available through nine AWS global regions and is now available on U.S. GovCloud as well. There are three paths to Splunk Cloud, the first path is our web self-service platform to trial and purchase Splunk Cloud with a credit card. The second path is with our field in-channel where new customers choose Splunk Cloud as the deployment model to accelerate time-to-value. Our few of the customers we added in Q2 include Tenneco, Pernod Ricard in France and Australia's Unify Solutions. The third path is where our existing on-premise customers are expanding their capacity with Splunk Cloud and deploying in a hybrid mode. A few of our hybrid customers this quarter includes AAA, City of Austin and London's Gatwick Airport. We continue to hear from customers that the ability to run a hybrid solution is incredibly powerful and important to them and Splunk is uniquely positioned to deliver on that. So, notable wins this quarter includes Infospace who replaced a competitive cloud-only log search company with Splunk Cloud and the Splunk App for AWS. We are helping them enable continuous delivery to their web publishing customers.
GEICO an existing Splunk customer expanded with Splunk Cloud taking advantage of the clouds favorable TCO. Maxim Caterers, the biggest food and beverage company in Hong Kong selected Splunk Cloud and our apps for PCI compliance for securing and analyzing their e-commerce data. And our largest Splunk Cloud order this quarter was from a social media company that signed a seven figure order for our multi-terabyte instance. This existing customer is expanding with Splunk and plans to transition from on-prem to the cloud. Customers want to know that their workloads are as reliable and secure in the cloud as they are on-premise. Splunk is there to help customers move to the cloud with confidence and now over to Haiyan.
Haiyan Song
Thanks, Marc. In Q2, we had great momentum and continued to strengthen our role at the nerve center for security. We again delivered triple-digit year-over-year bookings growth for ES. Customer demand for solutions that deliver faster time-to-value has driven the growth of ES on-prem and in the cloud. Here are some of our customer examples. The Securities and Exchange Commission expanded their use of Splunk Enterprise in ES as the security analytics platform where all IT and security data is monitored, analyzed and reported. Next time you are enjoying legendary steak at your local Texas road house restaurant. Think of Splunk as their nerve center. Splunk is the security team’s better ability to detect follow and shutdown attackers and give the IT Ops team visibility to improve customer experience on their Web site.
In addition to being as SIEM for situational awareness, Splunk is being increasingly viewed as the trusted security intelligence platform for breach response. This past quarter a high profile government agency and a well know university were both breached and subsequently purchased Splunk to beef up their security and breach response. The high note for security in Q2 with our acquisition of Caspida, a leading innovator in machine learning and data driven security, data science driven behavior analytics. It signifies our commitment to invest in accelerated innovation and extending our analytics driven security offering.
Customers can benefit from Caspida's machine learning solution to detect advance threat from external attackers and malicious insiders. Recent breaches have shown us the significance of identify and user credentials as an attack surface. And our first combined solution will focus on user and entity behavior analytic to help our customers with this critical security need. We are very excited to welcome this talented team and are working hard towards unveiling our plan for the integrated Splunk and Caspida's solution at our upcoming user conference in Las Vegas.
We feel privileged to be at a fore front of leading the industry transformation towards next generation analytics driven security. As 451 research noted, this emerging techniques are fundamentally reshaping the nature of security analytics and are moving towards defining an architecture that goes well beyond SIEM. For the third straight year, Splunk was named a leader in Gardner's magic quadrant for security information and event management in fact Splunk was the only vendor to improve its completeness of vision in their report. We could not ask for a better timing and showcase than this year's Black Hat USA which took place early August.
In addition to record visitors at Splunk boot all session on behavioral intuition detection had over a thousand attendees. Although Black Hat's network operation center is hidden in a dark room, Splunk was front-and-center powering the NOC that was described as ""the nerve center for one of the most hostile technology environment on the planet"".
Splunk's analytics and visualizations helped keep that advance network secured and operational. I am proud of the momentum we have in the market and the result we have delivered in the security business and look forward to continuing to innovate and expand our security solution to help our customers.
Now back to Godfrey.
Godfrey Sullivan
Thanks Doug, Marc and Haiyan. I have to say that I'm really proud of the Splunk's executive team. Our core development teams keep cranking out with impressive functionality that shows in our net promoter score of 50 almost unheard of in enterprise software. The market groups are defining strategy, product direction and building an enviable ecosystem for their solutions. Our cloud business is accelerating based on clear strategy and maniacal operational focus. And our superb field organization just keeps getting stronger and even better at delivering customer success. I hope to see you at Comp next month where we will raise a curtain on our product releases, enjoy a wide range of killer presentations by our customers and host for you the financial community an interactive panel with our exec team. It's going to be a great show and I can wait to get together with you there.
Again thanks to all of our customers and partners and thanks to everyone who works at Splunk for another great quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to CFO, Dave Conte.
Dave Conte
Hey thanks Godfrey. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Q2 was another strong quarter and we're pleased with our first half performance and certainly excited about our outlook for the remainder of the year. Second quarter revenues were $148.3 million, a 46% increase over Q2 last year. License revenues grew 42% year-over-year totaling $88 million. In Q2 and now for 13 out of 14 quarters as a public company, more than 7% of our license bookies came from existing customers in a form of up sale for additional capacity and expansion from new use cases. 
Also we booked more orders in Q2 than in any prior quarter in our history. We recorded 327 orders greater than a $100,000. As Godfrey mentioned we have more than 10,000 customers globally. On prior calls I mention that the ratable mix of bookings continues to very substantially quarter to quarter. As a refresher, the contributors to the ratable mix are term license contracts, Splunk Cloud and certain EAAs. Let's talk about EAAs for second, just a few remainders. The EAA is a ratable because they are either a standalone term license or include a term license component. These contracts are typically three years in duration and in many cases, only the first year is immediately billable. Subsequent years of the contract are usually billable on an annual basis. So, you're not going to see those extra three years on the face of the financial statements.
Today these unbilled amount have not been significant to the financials overall. Now the mix for the quarter was 41% which is on the high end of our annual range. We've experienced and that we've expressed that to substantial agree the ratable mix will swing from quarter to quarter and it generally follow seasonal patterns. As a result we’ll take a longer range view the mix, given its unpredictable nature.
For now, we maintain our current full year guidance of 30% to 40%. Though we’re likely to end the year at the top end of that range based on first half results. We're going to keep updating you guys as we gain more insight in terms of how that mix is trending. Now as Marc mentioned earlier, we're pleased with our cloud momentum. Both existing and new customers are utilizing cloud services for various use cases and hybrid deployments.
As it relate to the impacted cloud on our financials, recall that cloud revenue is captured entirely in the services line on the P&L and the associated costs are reflected in the cost of services. Importantly, there are no cloud related revenues allocated to the license line, even though most of this revenue relates to the use of our software. Eventually, when cloud revenues become a significant component of total revenues, we’ll report it separately much like you’re accustomed to seeing with peer staff models. As we’ve said, we expect to growth in our cloud business to continue to impact both the composition of revenues between license and services and associated gross margins. More on margins in a minute.
Now back to the results. In Q2, international operations represented approximately 23% of total revenues consistent with previous levels. Our education of professional services represented 7% of revenue in Q2 in the range of prior and expected levels of between 5% and 10%. Remember since we generally recognize revenues on services when they are delivered and billed, services bookings typically do not flow through the balance sheet as deferred revenue.
With respect to margins, which are all non-GAAP. Q2 overall gross margin was 88% unchanged from Q1 and as expected, starting to show the impact from our ramping cloud business. Operating income was $4.8 million, representing a positive margin of approximately 3%. Q2 net income was $4.1 million and EPS was $0.03 per share based on a fully diluted share count of 132 million shares. 
Cash flow from operations was $13.6 million and free cash flow was about $10.8 million. We ended the quarter with over 900 million in total cash and investments which reflects the net cash paid of a $143 million for the Metafor and Caspida acquisitions. Now looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect Q3 total revenues of between $158 million to $160 million with a 1% to 2% positive non-GAAP operating margin. With our first half performance and Q3 outlook, we now expect full year revenues to range between $628 million and $632 million, up from our prior guidance of $610 million to $614 million.
Since we denominate revenue globally in U.S. dollars, we do not have foreign exchange exposure on the revenue line. As we continue to increase our investments in market groups, product teams, the field and Splunk cloud we expect to generate positive non-GAAP operating margins of between 2% and 3% for the full-year consistent with last year's level and prior guidance.
Note that our OP margin target incorporates the expense run rates of both the Metafor and Caspida acquisitions. I’ve said that our margin targets include the impact of a gradual 1% to 2% increase in cost of services from growing our cloud business. It also includes higher professional services cost delivered around our market group solutions.
As a housekeeping item, since we expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis for the balance of the year, full year EPS calculations, you should use fully diluted share counts of approximately 134 million in Q3 and a 137 million shares in Q4. We remain committed to running the business on a positive operating cash flow basis and continue to expect that full year operating cash flow will be approximately 20% of total revenues with the quarterly levels following the trend we've seen over the past several years. 
As I’ve mentioned, fiscal '16 is a higher than typical CapEx year, as we expect the bulk of our San Francisco HQ build-out cost will be incurred this year. When combined with global facility expansion to accommodate our growing employee base, we expect approximately $50 million in total CapEx this year. First half CapEx totaled $10 million and expect the remain 40 million will come in the back half of the year mostly in Q4.
In closing, our team continues to execute on our mission to deliver exceptional value to our customers and we're committed to continuing investments in our products, solutions and overall global reach. Q2 ended a solid first half and I’m enthusiastic about our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '16.
With that let's open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill of UBS.
Brent Thill
Dave, the term mix continues to come in above your guide range and I realize you ended with a comment that you expect it to end closer to the high-end of your range and you gave a 30 to 40, but I'm curious just in terms of the economics of what you're seeing in those contracts versus the perpetual world. How you look at the trade-off and how you think about the long-term value to those deals versus what you're seeing on the perpetual side?
David Conte
As you know the predictability in any 90-days cycle of what that mix is going to be is been a fun item to try to forecast and that's from three-years ago when we first went public. I think what's important about the life-time value of those arrangements when we think about mix is, how we're enabling customers to adopt the product. You know that's our objective. How do we structure arrangements that give the customer the predictability around their investment in Splunk and the freedom to deploy it broadly across the enterprise? So, in terms of life-time value, I mean the mathematics around it, I think a three-year maybe a four-year term contract is equivalent to standard perpetual license, but when looking at the cohort of a customer, and the adoption trends, we think it's obviously far more valuable in terms of overall LTV of those customers.
Brent Thill
And quick follow-up for Godfrey and Haiyan on the security side, you had a really impressive run there and I'm just curious when you look at the Halo impact that your security business is now having on other aspects of the Splunk -- go-to-market and new products, so what are you seeing in terms of landing those best security customer, how quickly you're starting to see that now spread into other areas of governance risk compliance?
Godfrey Sullivan
Well, I just said it, maybe overall comment on that, that which is that, if you would asked me that question three of four years ago, I always coached our field organization to go into IT operations first because you could spread more quickly from then and I was always a little bit reserved around going into security department first with a customer because I was always a little fearful that we'd get deposition there as a security like a SIEM, which would be not great for us. And I think that market has changed so much in the last three years that the security department is often now the keeper of the Splunk index and that -- but the difference is for the first time that it's serving as a steward for a lot of machine data across the organization. So, I think it's as easy for us now to enter security and then expand across to app dev or IT operations or business analytics as it was three or four years ago for us to enter in through IT ops or apps and then spread to the security department.
I think that if you look at our -- all of our EAA's and you look at our large customer orders, all of them are multiple use case. Almost every single one of them is because Splunk has become a data platform and we're being used across multiple departments, multiple use cases. So, I think it's changed a lot in the last two or three years, all for the better for our customers and us.
Haiyan Song
Very well said.
Operator
Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss
Maybe following in on that Dave, when we think about the recent acquisition, the Caspida and the Metafor, are these additional functionality that’s going to be sold as perhaps like a separate application, is it a separate sort of paid for functionality on a going forward basis? Or does this just become sort of part and parcel of the strength of the underlined platform? And on that related note, as we think about that back half guidance is there any revenue contribution attributed to those acquisitions?
Godfrey Sullivan
So, multi-part question, multi-speaker answer. I'll take the Metafor piece which is to say that, in that case that's really more or like a technology acquisition that you're likely to see incorporated into things like our IT service intelligence solution as opposed to a standalone app for example, but time will tell, we have a lot of -- there is some very robust technology there that we think will be very helpful to us in IT operations Caspida is a little bit different than that, so Haiyan I'll hand to you the Caspida piece.
Haiyan Song
Caspida had served in this fast moving market called behavior analytics especially focusing on users and we anticipate that's going to be additional capabilities, we continue to build and integrate and we'll continue to offer it as a standalone product as well as giving us options to offer bundles and more choices for the customer. In terms of revenue we are in a very early stage and we are running early accessed programs. As I mentioned I will be unveiling more of the details on this integrated plan at .com. So looking forward to talking to you guys then.
Dave Conte
And hey Keith it's Dave, specifically in terms of our model and our outlook as Haiyan mentioned and we're really focused on ensuring that the technology and how we bundle that in with our overall security solution is paired appropriately with our existing ES application. Our model assumes no revenue contribution because we're really not planning to have a major roll out of that solution until towards the end of the year. So we don’t have any revenue built in today.
Keith Weiss
Got it. And if I could sneak one more clarification in. I think Doug mentioned adding more than 100 global field positions during the quarter, I'm assuming that’s not all quota carrying reps. Can you give us little bit more color on sort of what those global field positions were and maybe give us a number of quota carrying reps exiting the quarter? 
Godfrey Sullivan
Sure Keith. We have been a little more focused going into this year and making sure that we gaining critical mass in different markets and that we have a well-balanced hiring approach. So we've concentrated hiring in a handful of customers where we've seen critical mass in the U.S. and public sector really worked for advantage, we are mirroring that model, but we also are ensuring that we're maintaining the right manager-to-rep ratio so they can actually do their job of growing and developing the reps effectively. We’ve got the right presales ratios. It’s a great technical sale and we’ve seen consistently that having the technical side of the house walk the halls with the reps greatly increases their education and knowledge thus gained can help spread us those use cases. And we’ve been talking about some of these specialized resources that carry distinct security, capability, variety operations capability or app dev our business analytics for others and we're also adding that specialization of both sales and presales around the globe so that we can increase our win rates or maintain our run rates within those categories.
David Conte
Hey Keith, it’s Dave. Let me pile on little bit. I'm really excited to see adding that type -- over a 100 resources in the field organization all around the initiatives that Doug mentioned. As you guys know we've been talking now over a year about building out our capabilities around our core markets and Haiyan doing a terrific job in security as you know [indiscernible] fits and we're excited about our -- the intelligent app that we’re going be talking about at .com. So these investments have been really important in terms of how we deliver value to the customer. So seeing that type of momentum in terms of our ability to get coverage and reach around all these initiatives and the field organizations create over a 100 in a single quarter. The back half of your question is how many are quota carriers? So we ended the quarter with 362 quota carriers that’s up I think about 36%-37% year-over-year, 30 plus incremental quota carriers since the last quarter.
Keith Weiss
Excellent and a great August. Thank you.
Godfrey Sullivan
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi.
Walter Pritchard
Question of mine is around the drivers of the cloud business and I'm wondering if you could help us understand how many of these customers are sort of born in the cloud or customers that maybe wouldn’t have looked at your product two years ago or three years ago when you didn’t have the cloud offering. And then of the customers that are more traditional based, what's causing them to consider the cloud offering versus just assuming the kind of capacity that they’ve consumed for a while.
Marc Olesen
Hey Walter this is Marc. Thanks for the question. Obviously we're extremely excited with the demand we are seeing in the market place for cloud solutions and thrilled with our growth to date. It's really as solution and a delivery option that’s appealing to customers of all shapes and sizes, so we have very small customers, small departments that are using cloud as an entry way into Splunk and their first experience and at the same time we've got customers that are sending us the multiple terabytes per day and they are really two main drivers around this. So the first is just, where do you want to focus your time efforts, energy and attention, on running Splunk or on using Splunk. So that’s one of the drivers and the other one is where is the source of the data?
So for a lot of work loads that are running in the cloud there is a lack of interest in back hauling all that data to an on premise deployment. It was already in the cloud, we've already rationalized that so really make sense to send it to a smart cloud. But with the additional options the Splunk Cloud presents for customers we definitely see an expanding addressable because of that and of course we offer a hybrid solution for our customer so that they can run Splunk enterprise on-prem and Splunk Cloud and that we’re actually the only solution in the market place that gives customers that true hybrid experience where they can search seamlessly across data stored on-prem and in the cloud and to the user they can be able to get that unified experience.
Godfrey Sullivan
Okay. Thank you next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian White from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Brian White 
I'm wondering if you can talk just a little bit about the orders over a 100,000. I went back in my model, looks like it’s the strongest sequential growth we've even seen for a July quarter for this big orders, so number one, what's kind of the dynamic, you see out in the field? And number two, maybe you talk about price changes in the July quarter and what was the ASP that we saw? I think previously you talked 40,000 to 50,000, what are we looking at this quarter? Thanks.
Doug Merritt
So on the six and seven figure orders, I think we're just doing, as we saw with the hiring, we talked through with the focus and the expansion we're driving on the rep and overall sales basis, we're just doing an increasingly better job, I think, finding opportunities but even more importantly adding into customer success or really driving these opportunities, driving Splunk across multiple different departments and use cases. So that we can drive ourselves into these organizations as a data -- fabric and data platform and those by nature driver larger deals. So, it's a -- we got the wonderful challenge of making sure we have enough reps to cover the Brownfield [ph] accounts and that we're still paying attention to Greenfield and as we're driving these Brownfields your seeing bigger orders come out. Dave, do you want to handle the ASP?
Dave Conte
Yes. So ASPs, we are at the top end of that range at about 50k and it's interesting so you look at to your point sequential increase and the year-over-year increase in terms of large orders and yet ASPs are consistent and back to my prepared remark, this was our individually largest quarter in terms of total orders overall. So the velocity in the business is growing not just in terms of large orders but all orders in total and that's how you get a consistent ASP given 320 something plus, 60 or transactions.
Brian White
Okay. And just as a follow up any update on Hunk?
Godfrey Sullivan
As far as market dynamics, we're continuing to see more interest in Hunk, but it's limited by the amount of production, HTFS instances that we see out there. So, we’re slowly growing and I think we'll continue to be -- a little bit held back by how industrial strength and production focused are these HTFS initiatives.
Brian White
Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Mr. Hedberg your line is open.
Matt Hedberg
Sorry about that. Congrats from me as well, thanks again. I know you guys have said in the past, security use cases can make up between 35% and 40% of some of your deals. We had a resource survey, it looks like it could be as high as being 50% next year, I guess with the acquisition that you're doing here, does that level of activity seem reasonable to you guys?
David Conte
Hey Matt, it's Dave. So, as you know, security maybe two plus years ago was 20% to 25% of business and the end of last year it ended up to being not quite 50%, but over 40%. Q2 was about 40% of the total business, how that massages over time, the challenge for any individual market group is the other market groups are doing really well also. So, our core markets of ITOA now over 50% of the business is looking great. I'm sure Snehal who has business analytics will have something to say about it, once he gets some more tenure under his belt, but I wouldn't say it's unreasonable but really will fluctuate quarter to quarter and this is important, when you look at the composition of our transactions, some of our more mature customers who tend to do the large orders, can swing that percentage on a quarterly basis from an annual trend I think it's still appropriate to think about security as that 35% to 45% of the business until we see something change in terms of the analytics based. 
Godfrey Sullivan
I hate to pile on an answer, but I will here. Which is, in the six figure orders, the five figure and low six figure orders tend to be easier to track because they're often a single use case. Most of our large six figure on almost every seven figure order is because a customer is using Splunk as a data platform and they're using it across multiple departments and use cases, and then you get into allocation game, so I don't know how precise this market group number will be as we continue to move into a platform and we’ll just have to give you the best color we have based on going to the customer information and trying our best to sort it out. But part of being a platform is that you got multiple use cases with always big orders. 
Matt Hedberg
That's helpful. And then maybe I guess as a follow up to that, you guys obviously have great partnerships Palo Alto in particular, it seems like there are number of nice deals through that partner, is there a risk that you guys could start to incorporate additional features that could eventually start to compete with some of these partners or is it still of the mindset that its complementary to some of those existing relationships?
Godfrey Sullivan
I don't think there is much overlap and I don't see any on the near horizon. Do you Haiyan?
Haiyan Song
I think great question, in security there is a lot of overlapping in terms of the words people used. But in terms of the particular problems, the angle we’re solving problems just like Godfrey was saying, I don't think there is any overlap per say, so we continue to have great partnerships and for us Splunk will be a successful as the ecosystem we serve and the ecosystem that customer uses to put up their security defenses.
Godfrey Sullivan
So there is just not enough marketing words to go around.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JP Morgan.
Mark Murphy
Yes, thank you all. I’ll add my congratulations. Godfrey, I wanted to ask you, as you build toward the seasonally strong fiscal Q4, we look back at past years and you’ve produced approximately 60% sequential growth in billings and I know that the numbers are getting larger and that might not always happen. But we know that you build pipeline toward that all year long. So just given some of the recent gyrations in the equity markets, I was curious what is your sense of pipeline build, are customers calm and thinking rationally, and maybe how do you feel about the set up for year-end budget flush activity?
Godfrey Sullivan
Yes, I mean enterprise software is enterprise software. So customers are well trained to try to use end of near to their advantage and so I don’t think this Splunk is different than any other company in that regard. I don’t know that we’ll see impact of equity markets for another quarter or two because what if any impact all this equity market gyration will have doesn’t show up on a day-to-day basis. It would really be more about does it impact company’s budget for next year, do they change their outlook for next year. But I don’t sense that the market has had much impact over the last week, in last 30 minutes. It's really hard to sort that out and our guidance as we’ve constructed it for Q3 and Q4 take that into consideration.
Mark Murphy
Thank you. And as a follow-up Godfrey I was looking on full Splunk pace and the number of aps by vendor, there are 151 for Microsoft, 29 for Cisco, 13 for Oracle. Just wondering why do you think that it is so heavily skewed towards Microsoft, is Microsoft that disproportionate in terms of the critical systems that are producing all this high value machine data or do you think the others are just temporarily underrepresented in there and that they are likely to close that gap overtime?
Godfrey Sullivan
No, I would say is because Microsoft tends to be a little bit more -- it's closer to the operating system level. You almost have to compare Microsoft and our apps on Splunk based to Unix as opposed to comparing it to Cisco for example and there is just so many different utilities. They might not rise to the -- they certainly don’t rise to the description of a solution or a full app they might be more of a connector or plug-in and description. So the words are little bit hard to -- like there aren’t enough words to go around that either and we try to over simplify.
But I would say that in the case of Cisco there are enough different security environments and enough different products in the Cisco world that almost all the apps apply to a product or technology that’s distinct. In the Microsoft world there is sometime three or four of them that customers have published, that’s all the same problem in a slightly different way. So it's a little bit, I just wouldn’t over analyze it, it's an -- it's not something we spend any time on, let's put it that way.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse.
Joanna Kamien
It's Joanna Kamien on for Phil, thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering with this integrated solution with Caspida, from a competitive standpoint, who you guys are going to be going up against or displacing, and if you are displacing generation one SIEM vendor. Do you think Splunk is also seeing a net broader deployment inside of these customers versus the generation one SIEM vendor? Thanks guys.
Haiyan Song
I’ll take that, so Caspida brings behavior analytics into our already very much analytics driven and centric solution to security. So we have seen great momentum in adoption of the new approach, we’re seeing great momentum in replacing like you said, the previous generation solutions around SIEM and we also -- I think as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, people are increasingly looking to us to provide the best solution around breach response. So definitely an expanded use case beyond SIEM and we see very good traction in replacing some of the old generation solutions that were there.
Godfrey Sullivan
And while you are on the horn we’d like to know if you can throw little dirt about Phil on the horn, since he is not on the call.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turtis from Raymond James.
Michael Turtis
It's Michael Turtis, question on EA is anything more you can tell us about the rate of adoption, whether it's getting material and what the use case has been for EA? And then I’ve got a follow-up.
Dave Conte
Sure Michael, so as we contagiously talk about 70% of our revenue roughly comes from existing accounts and I think that in the [indiscernible] got for years ago, I am calling this enterprise adoption agreement is the key. We’re seeing growth within these accounts to try and treat Splunk as a platform and in enterprise agreements of various flavors are helping to thrive that. They wrap in things like professional services and some instances, Splunk advisory engineers are customer success oriented folks, education credits, headroom that the account can grow into and I do think that they are important contributor to that 300 plus six and seven figure deal accounts that we saw this quarter. It’s just, anything that we can do to make it easier for our customers to learn Splunk, get more data into Splunk, see the value of the additional correlations and use cases as they do that. It's great for the customer and I think obviously ultimately long-term, really good for Splunk too.
Unidentified Company Representative
Hey Michael it's [indiscernible]. I think in term of quantifying how many EAA's are we doing. The absolute number isn't as relevant. I think it's important that we have the program and the vehicle so that customers can actually get to standardization. But what we are seeing that ultimately bridges from the initial new customer using Splunk over the lifecycle and the maturity of their deployments to becoming a EAA customer is -- I’d say velocity around multiple use cases in the same account and I think that's part in parcel to the previously mentioned metric that again over 70% of the business is in installed base, that doesn’t means 70% or more of the bookings are EAAs, that’s customers deploying multiple use cases across their departments and now paired with hybrid search capabilities in the cloud. So the combination of on-prem plus Cloud deployments, plus multiple use cases across multiple departments. That’s what we’re seeing I think quite frequently in the customer base. Ultimately those customers will become EAA's in our contract, but they are not there today. 
Michael Turtis
Got it. And then my final question was around the issue of the mix -- the shift towards ratable and the impact on growth obviously We’ve all tried to do calculations on it, anything else that we can help us for this quarter 46% revenue, 43% billings growth is very strong, but and we also expect that something, the quota run rate or real rates are bit higher, any that helps us there?
Unidentified Company Representative
While I’ll try to add some clarity; we measure the mix as the percentage of our gross bookings. The calculations that we can all do off the face of the financial statements are effectively the derived billings number and as I mentioned in prepared remarks, we do have a component of contract value that’s unbilled. It's not significant in the context of the overall financials that I'll be disclosing it, but it would obviously when included, uptake the growth rate some, but it's not so differentiating that I would say holy smokes, the 46% growth rate isn’t good enough and you guys should understand that there is this whole other basket of growth.
But as we see more and more multiyear contracts in the billing characteristic for those and we think that there is a components that lacking that you don’t -- that you are not getting clear visibility in terms of assessing our performance, then we'll obviously include that. I think as reported -- I think it demonstrate the strength of the quarter and the momentum we have in the business.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Egbert from Piper Jaffray.
Katherine Egbert 
Hi thanks. You mentioned a couple of times in the call about win rates. Can you just give us an update on the competition and how its pricing is going?
Godfrey Sullivan
We remain in an enviable position on win rates. I just sat through a series of QVR's as would normally happen the first month of the new quarter and one of things we review is, how we’re doing against competition and that Splunk is a data platform approach that we have still seems to be pretty big darn differentiated. We had a couple of nice win backs or takeaways from competitors, some open source competitors, some smaller cloud or other based competitors and what I just keep seeing over and over is customers no matter what they experiment with come back to Splunk as the most complete solution that drives the lowest total cost of ownership for them and I think more importantly get production worthy high value visibility around this complex data equation quickest for them. It's just -- it’s been fun to watch.
Katherine Egbert 
Okay, thanks. Dave and then a couple of quick financial questions, you are now solidly profitable in terms of operating margin and it looks like it will be that way for the rest of the year. Will you stay that way you’re thinking into fiscal '17?
Dave Conte
Yes. Hey Katherine I think obviously we expect this year fiscal '16's margin to be consistent with the prior year. And the rate at which we're investing on annual basis I would not expect to deviate significantly from that two year trend. Might that be a couple of 100 basis points up or couple of 100 basis points down as we manage our investments across all these initiatives and when we get to the end of the year and we look at our priorities and we set our internal objectives that we then will share with you guys. We'll update it for sure. But in terms of the position that we are in, in terms of the maturity of our market and our penetration in terms of the size of the TAM we're really focused on continue to investment because we see just a tremendous amount of growth ahead, so making sure that we go capture all those customer use cases and continue to delight them with our products and reach them with our field organization and elevate our value with solutions is critical and of course that requires investment. So, again I would expect maybe a couple of hundred basis points of deviation but I’ll update you when we get to the end of the year.
Katherine Egbert
Okay and then just quickly, did the acquisitions add any revenue this quarter?
Dave Conte
No.
Katherine Egbert
Okay. Thanks, good job. 
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Kash Rangan
Couple of questions, with respect to the success Splunk has had in its widely adopted, get to the point where customers like it so much that it then starts to get expensive and then you come back with the EAAs and cloud. To what extent is that, oh I love it, but it's little expensive, is still prevalent in your sales cycle? Is the come down stable? And secondly, when your business mix are shifting towards more subscription, how are you measuring sales productivity and what is the trend there? And third and final my favorite question for Dave Conte, you said 40% of gross bookings subscription, but I would assume that given that roughly half your businesses is off the income statement, on the balance sheet, off the balance sheet, what does your growth rate not at least 2x of your reported growth? Thank you.
Godfrey Sullivan
Tricky question. 
Doug Merritt
[Multiple speakers] So, I do think that the EAA discussion options and especially the unlimited EAA have helped a bit as far as people’s perception of a variable pricing metric that they don't have, that they perceive they don't have full control over around the per gigabytes of data invested. But what I'm seeing is the more notable trend within more of the bigger companies that have now gotten their minds more wrapped around any big data solutions is they’re understanding the total cost of driving these types of solutions in their company and no matter what we charge for our software, whether we give it away, keep current price, we're 10% to 15% of the total investment necessary on compute, network, storage, manpower around that and why I just see this clip that's been really consistent, let me go try something else and then come back to Splunk is great product characteristics, great time-to-value. But ultimately they realize, you guys are significantly cheaper because the huge boat that follows you and follows anyone that's going to be big data arena is so much smaller and so much more efficient and then the manpower against it, is significantly more efficient.
So, I think that are competitive differentiation will continue to be really, really quick time to value because of our integrated approach across the multiple aspects of our platform and the differentiation of our technology.
David Conte
And Kash, it's Dave. As we have discussed in prior periods, I do agree with you that if you look at total gross bookings, the growth rate would be higher than what you see derive from the financial statements. But I'm not necessarily agreeing with the map that you have in terms of the rate that growth would be if you include all the contract value.
Kash Rangan
So I guess, the booking is a one year booking, right? But the breakeven point for a subscription versus license is more like a three years, so if were to convert that into a pro forma basis, my thinking is that the growth rate is not just a little bit above, but a lot above, that conceptually that's what I'm steering towards.
David Conte
Sure. Now, remember though that a typical large order that has a term component is three year in duration, now not all of that contract value is on the financial statement as I mentioned in prepared remarks and in the one year variety, we're not measuring any renewal stream that we expect to receive, we're not doing any pro forma calculations that will take an annual contract value and converted into a total contract value, we're not doing that math implied growth rate.
Kash Rangan
I'm doing that, and that's why I'm getting much higher growth rates.
David Conte
That's right.
Godfrey Sullivan
And Kash, I want to thank you for making Conte work a little bit on this call. 
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Rizzuto from SunTrust. 
John Rizzuto
This question is little bit more qualitative than anything and it's really -- if you look at the potential for Splunk, I know, you like to think I kind of forecast it, you are only scratching the surface of how big you can be. So in that sense, you're really only just starting the race and the metrics just they keep coming up, they look great, you could be on autopilot but clearly you're not doing that internally, what are the things? To what you can that you’re looking at internally to make sure that your business is operating or grabbing the opportunity in front of it that it has, such that as growth rates potentially may flow, you're still solidifying your grip and your hold of the marketplace?
Godfrey Sullivan
Well a good question and I'm happy to give a very short answer to that. There are three things that I think about on a continuing basis to make sure we are driving this opportunity as hard as we can. Number one is improving the technology from top to bottom of the stack. We continue to improve the core Splunk enterprise and all the core platform elements so that it can be the very best indexing engine and data analytics device known to man. But that also has to encompass the solutions business, hence our market groups. So being able to add solutions and apps on top of that like Enterprise Security which has become such a force in the marketplace, like a Speedo which we'll be next year like IT service intelligence and on and on. So making sure that we have the best whole product regardless of what the customers' use case is, so that R&D spend is job one.
Closely following that is cloud because the next major growth area for us is to make sure that we capture everyone's business regardless of where they want to deploy it and there are so many customers who have a lot of on-prem business but also are putting new projects in the cloud and we're so uniquely positioned to help the company bridge their way from on-prem to the cloud because of our hybrid approach and because of the flexibility of our software and our fast deployment times. We're just -- there's nobody in the market place as Doug said, there's nobody that can deploy and deliver success as fast as we can.
And the third is coverage. And it's all about field, it's about field expansion, it's about as Doug said it's about sales positions, technical positions, customer success, it's a highly technical world we live in and you can't just put salespeople on the street and be successful, you have to put a very strong technical team on the street to help the customer achieve success and really understand these complex issues and somehow Splunk magically translates all these very complex dated issues into very rapid deployment success.
So now back to the beginning. Core R&D plus solutions is one, cloud is two and all types of coverage is three. And that's it. As long as we keep doing that I think we have a pretty good runway in front of us.
John Rizzuto
Great, and then just a follow up to that, looking at one, you bought two companies here in anomaly detection and behavioral analytics which is, they could be thought of as run of the mill applications but that actually seems like it may be an inflection point on where you can take your technology particularly in terms of the remediation, prescriptive, analytic, automation and detection. What do you think that tech -- how important these technologies are to the next generation Splunk or are they not?
Godfrey Sullivan
They're important, Splunk's reputation, Splunk's brand to the degree that are technology brand is built around highly flexible search, it's fantastic, but customers don't want to be limited to just search, like if I just keep searching I'll find the anomalies or I'll find the unusual patterns or I'll find the outliers. They want Splunk to tell them where those patterns are and to tell them where the outliers are to be able to compare known versus new so that you don't have to do everything through a query. So it doesn't matter whether you're talking about security or IT operations or business analytics, the customer transactional sort of questions, any type of process analysis, you want to be able to compare new versus old or rare versus normal and those types of things. So the whole notion of machine learning, anomaly detection and the like is core to a whole new set of applications of which insider threat and user behavior analytics are just two examples, but you have to have those core technologies in order to move from sort of query to pattern recognition.
Haiyan Song
If I may just add, one quick thing, I mentioned we're increasingly being playing the role at the nerve center, you can just think of that, two acquisitions as a major boost to the brainpower that we'll bring to the customer.
Operator
Thank you. And we have time for one final question for today. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne
I guess Godfrey, I just wanted a quick update on what you're thinking about some of the opportunity to sort of expand the ICE platform -- ICE partner opportunity on top of your data platform, I think you talked a couple of times in the call about Splunk evolving into more of a data platform. Obviously a platform sort of takes the ability to build more and more apps on top of it, you guys have obviously built a lot of apps yourself. I guess where do you guys stand in terms of bringing on new ICE's that might be approaching data from a more vertical perspective or could help you guys extend some of the used cases and build solutions around, some of your underlying technology. I'm just curious, where we stand on that heading into .com next month?
Godfrey Sullivan
I'll probably, I'll give you a short answer today and punt the rest of that answer to come because I didn't really do a lot of homework around our most recent stats there, but part of what I've asked Snehal to do is to really beef up the team we have that’s doing all of the developer certifications. We have all the tools, we have all the API's and the FDK's, we have a lot of the technology bits to help the developer organization and ISV set of companies, become more and more competent and capable of success on top of the Slunk engine.
Where we’re a little behind on resources is actually helping them test and certified those apps to make sure that when stuff goes up on Splunk base that it's really easy for customers to tell what’s like an open source submission versus something that’s been tested in an enterprise environment and the I think that for the IVFs of the world the number one thing enterprise customers ask me is have those apps been tested and you're certain, if they can work in an enterprise production environment without fail. And that’s a very different level of fit and finish that the customers are now asking us to make sure of. So the organization we have that helps our developers, our developers be successful is kind of a next area of major investment for us and I think it will be a little easier for us to kind of give you a complete walkthrough on that, or at least a brief walkthrough on it at comp, I’ll try to build that into the remarks we’re preparing for the investor Q&A for the panel.
But anyway, it's something that’s high on my mind, I think I would probably will get a little better organized to answer it for comp.
Kirk Materne
Great look forward to it. Thanks guys.
Ken Tinsley
Okay, thanks everyone. Thanks Karen for your help and we appreciate it. And we’re around here tonight if you have any follow-up questions. Hope you have a nice evening. Thanks everyone.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to GameStop Corporation's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A supplemental slide presentation is available at investor.gamestop.com. At the conclusion of the announcement, a question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically.
I would like to remind you that this call is covered by the Safe Harbor disclosure contained in GameStop publication documents and is the property of GameStop. It is not for rebroadcast or use by any parties without prior written consent of GameStop.
At this time, I would like would like to turn the call over to Paul Raines, CEO of GameStop. Please go ahead.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, operator, and welcome to the second quarter earnings call for GameStop. As always, we are grateful to our associates around the world for their performance and dedication to customers this quarter. They are the secret to GameStop's success.
Joining me today on our call are Rob Lloyd, Chief Financial Officer; Tony Bartel, Chief Operating Officer; Mike Mauler, President of International; Mike Hogan, Executive Vice President of Strategic Business; Mike Buskey, President of U.S. Stores; and Matt Hodges, Our Vice President of Public and Investor Relations.
We had a great quarter. Earnings per share growth was well ahead of consensus, growing 41% year-over-year. Our earnings per share grew 41% on top of 144% growth in the last year's second quarter. So comps are strong in the video game business, delivering 8.1% on top of last year's 22% comp. Digital growth without FX was 17.5% and pre-owned growth without FX was over 5%.
Technology Brands grew their store count by an impressive 182 stores now standing at 731 stores. Spring Mobile is now AT&T's largest dealer and our acquisition pipeline is full. Rob and Tony will provide color on the video game business and the Tech Brands' metrics.
During the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Geeknet and the ThinkGeek.com brand. We are very excited about this opportunity and have spent significant time with the Geeknet team on the integration plan. Mike Hogan will share some early color on our progress.
Our collectibles or Loot business had a very good quarter. What was once an experiment in Australia a little over two years ago has turned into a global business that is feeding rapid growth. As we see opportunities, we will continue to remodel GameStop stores to give more linear footage to Loot merchandise and less to video games, providing us a great competitive lever for the video game publishers. Integration with ThinkGeek will only help this business. Mike Mauler will update you on our global progress.
Last quarter's capital allocation was again disciplined as we paid our dividend of $0.36 per share and bought back $60.7 million worth of our stock.
Taking a moment to step back and look at the business, you have to recognize that we have a knack for identifying and developing opportunities in transformational technology and business acquisitions that are paying off for shareholders. Our early and rapid investments in refurbishing mobile devices has turned into our Technology Brands' unit, the fastest growing AT&T and Apple dealer in America. Our ability to adapt a great idea from Australia, adjust it to American consumers and roll it quickly has turned into our strong lineup of Loot and collectibles products. And our strong balance sheet allows us to capitalize on this success by rolling up great assets like Geeknet.
Our GameStop Technology Institute, announced in March of 2014, has developed an in-store tablet that is already rolling out nationally. And we have developed Beacon solutions that will soon be implemented as well. Our digital solutions of DLC, Steam, full-game download, Kongregate and Digital Game Informer, among others, are continuing to grow and will provide a nice $1 billion business this year. Underpinning all of these great ideas is great execution and the PowerUp Rewards program. It is clear to us now that we are finding new uses for our brick-and-mortar stores as well as our websites. And behind them is probably our biggest asset, the customer data behind all our transactions.
Our ability to diversify our business has been the correct strategy, building on our leadership in video games, while exploiting our core to grow rapidly in digital, mobile and collectibles. In the most recent quarter alone, those new businesses accounted for almost 23% of our gross profit and we expect to see that grow. You should note that our 32.9% gross margin rate for the second quarter was among the highest in our history. And gross profit dollars were a company record for the second quarter. Other categories like pre-owned may fluctuate, depending on mix and promotions. But our ability to diversify into richer lines of business and products is allowing us to increase profitability.
We provided guidance for Q3 that is slightly down to modestly up, and increased our full year guidance by the share count bought back in the quarter. We learned in our investor survey that setting achievable targets is important to you and expect to continue doing so. We continue to spend a lot of time internally and with our board on our strategic plan, assessing the size of markets and their adjacency to our core customer base. We seek more opportunities to leverage our core competencies of real estate, human talent, capital, buy-sell-trade, and PowerUp Rewards into attractive new segments. A high rate of change will continue to define us and will protect our family.
I will now turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today by covering the highlights of our successful second quarter. And then I'll dive into some color on the quarter.
Overall results exceeded our expectations again this quarter in terms of revenue growth, same-store sales, operating margin, net income and EPS. Sales increased 1.8% in the quarter, or 7.4% excluding FX. Comparable store sales increased 8.1%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 500 basis points. Gross margins exceeded 110 basis points on the strength of growth and margin expansion in mobile and growth in collectibles, leading to record second quarter gross profit of $580.5 million.
Adjusted operating earnings increased over 65% for the quarter, driven by our sales growth in collectibles and margin expansion in mobile. During the quarter, we incurred one-time charges of $9.1 million primarily relating to the Geeknet acquisition and Tech Brands' expansion, which included RadioShack store acquisition costs.
SG&A adjusted to exclude charges as a percentage of sales was 27.3%, down slightly from 27.5% in the prior-year quarter despite investments supporting Tech Brands' expansion. Interest expense increased $4.5 million due to the $350 million in debt outstanding. Adjusted net income increased 34.6% and adjusted EPS increased over 40%. Foreign currency moves reduced sales nearly $100 million, but had minimal impact on EPS.
Now let's look at sales and margin during the quarter for some of the categories. Hardware sales decreased 2.2% but increased 3.7% excluding FX because of strong demand for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In the U.S., we sold 42% more next-gen consoles than in the second quarter of 2014, leading to the outperformance in the comp results.
Software sales declined 6.0% but increased 0.7% excluding FX as we overcame the comparison to Watch Dogs and Mario Kart 8 from last year with strong performance on Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight. Pre-owned revenue grew 0.5% or plus 5.1% excluding FX as we saw continued growth in next-gen pre-owned hardware and software. Pre-owned margin rates were 46.0%, down 100 basis points from the prior year due to higher refurbishment costs on an increased mix of hardware and accessories trades which were driven by the successful trade-up campaigns we ran during the quarter.
Digital receipts on a non-GAAP basis grew 11.1% or 17.5% excluding FX to $199 million for the quarter. As we said in the release, growth was led by sales of DLC for Witcher 3 and Batman: Arkham Knight.
GAAP digital revenues declined 20.5% year-over-year due to FX impact and because of accounting for Kongregate on a net commission basis as we discussed in the first quarter call. Mobile revenues increased 26.9%, driven by a 62.3% growth in our Technology Brands revenues, and gross margins increased from 36.1% in Q2 last year to 45.4%.
As we stated on the last call, as we continue to rapidly expand our Tech Brands' footprint, there will be upfront investment costs in order to ensure successful openings. This will impact short-term operating results but will ultimately provide sustainable profits for the company.
During the second quarter we invested over $5 million for the 89 stores we opened and for the 90 to 100 stores to be opened during the third quarter. Q2's Tech Brands' store growth also included the acquisition of three AT&T resellers totaling 93 stores, most of which were acquired at the end of July.
Revenues in the Other category increased 37.7% to $99.4 million, or 48.5% growth excluding FX as we continued to expand our collectables business.
Some other data points are as follows. We closed a net of 33 video game stores around the world. As Paul mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Geeknet including the ThinkGeek brands and e-commerce site. The acquisition cost was $126 million net of cash acquired. ThinkGeek will be accretive in the second half of the year.
In the quarter we repurchased $60.7 million in stock or 1.41 million shares at an average price of $43.04. We surpassed the $1.8 billion mark in cumulative buybacks with over 71 million shares acquired at an average price of $25.28. We remain committed to our buyback program and are on track to meet our 2015 objective of repurchasing at least $200 million of stock. We also paid the second quarter dividend at $0.36 per share. In the last twelve months we've generated approximately $500 million in free cash flow and have returned $466 million in dividends and buybacks and have used an additional $247 million on acquisitions.
Now let's move on to third quarter guidance. As stated in our earnings release, we expect same-store sales to range from plus 1% to plus 4% and revenue growth to range from flat to positive 4%. Changes in foreign currency rates are expected to again negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million when compared to the third quarter of last year. Again, this quarter, we expect monthly software results from NPD to vary dramatically. The August title lineup is lighter than last year, with Madden being the only comparison.
In September, we will be comping Jetsons (13:33), which is a very tough overlap as this year's version is only an expansion pack. Assassin's Creed and Halo should give us a favorable comp in October.
Due to our over-indexing in market share on Destiny from last year, we are expecting new software revenue to be down in the third quarter. According to NPD in the U.S. nearly 3 million units of Destiny were sold across four platforms in the third quarter of last year. This quarter's most anticipated title is expected to be Halo 5, which launches very late in the quarter, and will only be available on One platform.
We also expect a slight decline in the pre-owned margin range as the mix shifts to next-gen from prior gen, and as we continue to invest in refurbishment of pre-owned consoles to support sales growth. Our repair costs remain comparable while pre-owned hardware prices decline over time. Also, as a reminder, sales of next-gen pre-owned units have a lower overall margin than prior-gen units due to higher trade-in prices, which is typical in a new console cycle. We are forecasting pre-owned margin to be between 44% and 46% for the balance of the year. Overall, we expect to expand gross margins compared to the prior-year quarter, as other areas of our business, such as Mobile and collectibles positively contribute to our profits.
Despite the upfront investment to support store openings, which I described earlier, operating earnings for Tech Brands in the third quarter, our forecast would be comparable to the prior year quarter, and are expected to grow significantly in the fourth quarter. We are guiding earnings per share for our third quarter to range from $0.53 to $0.60 per share. We are expecting a 37% tax rate for the quarter, which is higher than we had in the third quarter of last year and we will have approximately $0.02 per share in additional interest expense. You should model 106.7 million shares outstanding for the third quarter and 107 million for the full year based on buybacks through the end of the second quarter.
For the full year, total revenues are now expected to range from flat to positive 5%, and same-store sales are now expected to range from positive 2% to positive 7%. After considering buybacks we've completed thus far we're raising our full-year guidance from a range of $3.63 to $3.83 per share to a higher range of $3.66 to $3.86 per share.
I will now turn it over to Tony for his comments.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Thanks, Rob. Our retail operations had another strong quarter as we continue to capitalize on our unique specialty service model and grow our new, pre-owned, and digital video game business as well as our Technology Brands business. We believe that service matters and that our businesses are expanding because we meet the needs of our customers better than any of our competitors.
In new video games, we again increased share as our U.S. software grew 1.2% versus a decline in the overall market. Our software share increased by 1 point and we continue to sell over one half of all Xbox One and PS4 software.
Our U.S. new hardware dollar sales grew 13.6% during the quarter versus a decline in the overall market, resulting in 4 points of hardware market share gain during the quarter. The console launch remained strong in its 22nd month as we have tripled the number of PS4 units that were sold versus the PS3 launch and have nearly doubled the Xbox One units versus the 360 launch.
Our pre-owned business outpaced the new business and grew during the quarter as we logged 0.5% growth after FX and 5% growth prior to the impact of FX. As is normal during this part of the launch cycle, our increasing mix of next-gen sales is driving this growth. We are also in a good inventory position as our pre-owned inventory dollars are up 6% over the same period last year, driven entirely by next-gen hardware and software growth, so we are well poised to achieve mid single-digit global pre-owned growth for the full year.
Looking at digital, we again drove double-digit growth in non-GAAP digital receipts which increased 17.5% before FX and 11.1% after FX. This growth was driven mainly by the increase in downloadable content that was sold with new game launches. Kongregate will launch seven new mobile games this quarter and is on track to grow mobile gaming revenues by approximately 50% for the full year.
It is important to note that during the recent release of EA's Madden 16, we worked with our partners to offer a free physical game with the purchase of either a PS4 and Xbox One and did not carry the Xbox One digital bundle. We expect that if a game is provided as a promotional item in a hardware bundle, GameStop will see more of these physical offers than digital pack-ins on upcoming third-party releases.
In our Tech Brands' segment, we continued to extend our sales leadership of AT&T and Apple's brands in a high service manner as our Technology Brands division is experiencing explosive growth. We continue to execute our strategy of rolling out smaller dealers to improve productivity, and leveraging our real estate expertise in adding new locations.
Our Technology Brands division has had a very productive summer opening or acquiring 182 stores since the end of Q1. Our store count as of the end of Q2 stands at 731 stores. This represents a 129% increase in store count versus the end of Q2 2014. While we still plan on adding between 450 to 550 Technology Brands stores this year, the bulk of our investment spending is behind us. And we anticipate seeing strong growth in the back half of the year, culminating in our Technology Brands profits, growing between 40% and 50% for the full year without infrastructure investment costs, and 10% to 20% after such investment costs. This also sets us up for strong growth in 2016 and beyond.
Our Spring Mobile division is now not only the largest and fastest growing AT&T dealer, but they continue to be the most productive dealer as well. Jason Ellis, our Senior Vice President of Technology Brands and his team have done a great job of growing their business while maintaining a high service standard. We're also the largest and fastest growing Apple authorized reseller and a top five Cricket dealer.
In early August, we also began selling DIRECTV in all of our Spring Mobile stores, so we are now offering a full line of AT&T products and services in all of these stores. We are confident in our specialty retail expertise across all of our brands and optimistic about continued growth in the back half of the year and in 2016.
Finally, we leave this weekend for our annual store managers conference in Las Vegas, which will boast approximately 6,000 leaders from all of our companies and from around the world. We will have top leaders from all of our partners talking directly with our field leaders about their newest innovations and their plans for growth. The managers will also get hands-on experience on the latest innovations, most of which have never been seen by the public. This investment ensures that we will have the most knowledgeable sales team in our industries, and allows us to continue to provide better service than our competition.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Mauler.
Michael K. Mauler - Executive Vice President and President, Gamestop International
Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. GameStop's international businesses had a strong second quarter, exceeding expectations with record market share and a significant improvement in operating earnings over Q2 2014, led by our Australian business with a 10.2% same-store sales increase. Driving our increase in international earnings was digital receipt growth of 20% excluding FX, 30% e-commerce growth excluding FX driven by expanding web-in-store sales and the continued expansion of licensed merchandise and collectibles, or what our customers like to call Loot.
In the second quarter, Loot was our fastest growing sales category with global sales growing by more than 200% versus prior year, increasing customer basket size and expanding our gross margin rates. This rapid growth was driven by our continued expansion of the category in GameStop stores and proved merchandising and marketing expertise in the category.
Developing exclusive products, leveraging recent fan events such as Comic-Con, and exciting new product IP such as Minions, Inside Out, The Avengers: Age of Ultron and Batman: Arkham Knight. As mentioned on the last earnings call, as sales have continued to climb on these new products, we are increasing the space devoted to the category in all markets. Our second wave of in-store expansion was completed in the second quarter generating strong increases in Loot sales as well as expanding our customer base and driving increased traffic in our stores.
Finally, due to the success of our new standalone retail concept dedicated to Loot, we have continued to expand a Zing Pop Culture pilot in Australia and other markets. We ended the second quarter with 14 stores in Australia and 1 store in Dublin. We will continue to expand this new concept in the second half of 2015 in other markets, including the United States where we'll be opening our first location this fall under the brand name of ThinkGeek, leveraging the powerful brand of our recent acquisition of Geeknet. Mike Hogan will provide more details on this new business.
The expansion of this category continues to be met with very enthusiastic demand from our store associates and customers and we expect continued strong sales growth in the second half of 2015, driven by many outstanding entertainment launches such as Fallout 4, Hunger Games: Mockingjay and Disney's upcoming blockbuster, Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens, where we are seeing very strong pre-orders on our exclusive Loot offerings.
For the year we are targeting sales of $200 million to $250 million not including ThinkGeek. We are excited by this opportunity to drive continued same-store sales and margin growth and increasing relevance with our customers, and we expect this category to grow to an over $500 million business globally over the next three years.
And now, I will turn it over to Mike Hogan.
Michael P. Hogan - Executive Vice President, Strategic Business and Brand Development
Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. Paul asked me to comment briefly on our recent acquisition of ThinkGeek, our progress to date and our plans. As discussed previously, GameStop initiated a robust business development process a number of years ago to facilitate our diversification efforts. We are constantly exploring new opportunities that can apply core GameStop capabilities to drive future growth and value. Geeknet or ThinkGeek is a great example. We are expanding into a growing $20 billion worldwide category where we can leverage our core strengths to drive non-gaming revenue growth and profitability.
ThinkGeek provides a significant expansion of our global multichannel platform. We will utilize their product development and licensing expertise to broaden our collectibles product offerings and deepen our existing customer relationships while adding new ones. It is worth noting that GameStop's global multichannel business posted 28% growth for the second quarter. Multichannel is a key growth driver and we expect ThinkGeek to be a big part of continuing that growth.
Although the transaction closed a mere six weeks ago, I'm happy to report the integration is off to a great start. We continue to see great value in this acquisition. I want to begin by sharing a few key facts regarding the GameStop and ThinkGeek customer base, where we see significant opportunity. GameStop customers are a great fit for collectibles. In a recent survey, 67% of GameStop customers indicated they plan to purchase collectibles in the next 12 months. This is a huge opportunity for us to tap into.
Our PowerUp base aligns well with the category. 45% of PowerUp members have purchased collectibles in the past six months as compared to only 22% for all U.S. consumers. And we see upside for these current buyers. While PowerUp members are spending twice as much on collectibles as the average category buyer, ThinkGeek customers actually spend four times the average. We see significant upside for PowerUp member spending and for the category overall.
ThinkGeek is a powerful brand. 46% of PowerUp members are already familiar with the brand, double the awareness for all consumers. And finally, consumers are extremely satisfied with ThinkGeek, giving the brand a very impressive 68% Net Promoter Score.
Now a few thoughts on synergy and the growth opportunity. On the cost side, we are already seeing supply chain and purchasing synergies, some of which will positively impact the business in the current fiscal year. Geeknet posted an $8 million loss in fiscal 2014. We expect the business to already be profitable for the back half of this current year. There are a number of specific growth opportunities we are very excited about.
Web traffic, we recently began highlighting a few ThinkGeek products on GameStop.com to refer traffic. GameStop is already driving greater than 10% of total ThinkGeek traffic.
Profitable customers, GameStop provides a high-value customer for ThinkGeek, similar to what we have done successfully for Kongregate with mobile game purchasers. As with Kongregate, we expect traffic from GameStop to convert at well above the average.
Web-in-store, we have added a number of top-selling ThinkGeek products to our GameStop web-in-store program. This allows customers in GameStop stores to order products for home delivery. We just opened this up last week and we have already sold out of several key products.
Profitable promotions, GameStop and ThinkGeek collaborated to execute a 16th anniversary sale last week, which resulted in ThinkGeek's second highest gross margin day this year.
Pipeline, we expect significant growth in the back half of the year. We are excited about many exclusive new products, including a full lineup in support of the new Star Wars movie.
International expansion, we are also excited about the potential for offering ThinkGeek products in our European stores. We have already begun shipping a limited selection for the fall. ThinkGeek products are currently available in our Australian stores as well.
As Mike Mauler mentioned, we will have several ThinkGeek stores opening in the U.S. this fall, and we will feature ThinkGeek heavily at our managers show in Las Vegas next week. We are very pleased with the progress to-date, and we anticipate meeting or beating our initial synergy and growth expectations.
And finally, for those of you making up your holiday gifts lists early, I wanted to highlight a few unique products that ThinkGeek will be featuring over the next few months. Don't miss out on the Star Wars R2-D2 Bento Box. The Death Star Waffle Maker is sure to be a hit, or maybe a Tesla vacuum tube wristwatch or the ever-popular Knight Rider KITT Car Charger. You can all look forward to seeing one of these in your Christmas stocking.
I will now turn it back over to Paul.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Mike. We will now open it up for Q&A. Operator, please proceed.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We'll take our first question from Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thanks. Good afternoon and congratulations on a very nice quarter.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Colin.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Paul, first I wonder if you can add some color on the plan to reconfigure the stores, reduce the size of the video game category, and how you manage that change including timing? And then, secondly, looking back at the Q2 numbers, I mean clearly you saw strength in the Mobile and Consumer Electronic segments. Video game products declined a little bit. I wonder if you're seeing any impact there from full game downloads?
And then, lastly, in terms of the outlook for the remainder of the year, if you could maybe talk about some of the titles where you're perhaps seeing some particular strength in pre-orders that would be helpful. Thank you.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Colin. Let me start and handle the first and maybe, maybe Tony and Rob, you two guys think about two and three on what you think. I think, Colin, the way we see it this Loot thing, we've been researching it. Mauler and the team in Australia has been researching it for a couple years. It hasn't been a sudden event.
What we see though is that there's a tremendous adjacency between popular culture and video games. And if you remember back to our franchise marketing efforts that we did a few years ago we know that when the consumer is at a launch, they want to get every kind of item they can related to that particular title. If you're in line for Batman, you want the Batman t-shirt, the game, the everything that there is. And of course there's always been a lack of that merchandise. So we believe that the Loot has a significant place in our stores. Even if I was here today, Mike Buskey's here, our store leader. Mike, I think, what are you at? 20% overall Loot space, probably growing?
Mike Buskey - Executive Vice President and President U.S. Stores, GameStop Corporation
Yeah. Yeah.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's going to be a bigger part of our business. We believe it's a good investment in space and candidly, it gives us good leverage with publishers who haven't had that kind of competition before. So I think that's a good use of our space and as long as it's productive I think we should continue to do so. What about Mobile, Consumer, full-game downloads? Who wants to take that one?
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. So, Colin, it sounded like you said video game products were down. I want to correct that and say that before the impact of FX hardware was up, software was up, pre-owned was up, accessories were up and digital was up. So we're very pleased with what we saw in the quarter in the core video game business. I think I'll turn it over to Tony for any specifics on what we saw on the digital side.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Sure. And we continue to attach at a very high rate. For instance, in Madden that just launched, we had a 42% attach rate of digital to that title. So we have a very strong attach rate and we continue to be...
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's very high.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
It's very high and we continue to be very good at letting people understand exactly what they can buy from a digital standpoint. I remember that digital always suffers from two things, discoverability and affordability, and we do a great job on both of those fronts.
In terms of the games that we've very excited about it's really some of the new IP or at least IP that hasn't been out for a little while. Halo 5 is launching. As Rob talked about, it's going to be stronger in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter because it launches so late in our third quarter. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, we're excited to see the three-year development cycle and so very excited about that game coming out. And Fallout 4, which was announced, is also a game that we're looking forward to. And then Star Wars Battlefront, which is a whole new IP. So we're really excited about these new titles and that's why Rob I think shared his enthusiasm around the fourth quarter growth.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Colin.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. See you next week.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
We'll see you then.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
See you there.
Operator
We'll go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good afternoon. Congrats on a nice quarter.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Brian.
Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Couple of questions. First off, maybe somewhat of a follow-up to the prior quarter but on software, there was noise there. As we look at that year-on-year given the currency fluctuations and then some of the comparisons with last year's launches but as we step back from that and you look at the underlying trends there, how would you characterize the underlying software sales trend particularly with respect to new generation sales versus current and prior generation sales? And then I'll have a follow-up question.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Tony, do you want to take that?
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Sure. Given that the launch has been incredibly strong, we see them as definitely participating in that. Clearly, we talked about attach rates are a bit lower and when you take a look at our attach rates on this incredible launch cycle that we have, when you look at our physical and our digital attach rates together, we're very consistent with the prior launch. So when you think about the fact that we've tripled the amount of units that we've sold on the PS4 and almost doubled the Xbox One, you see that we have a very strong – we feel very good about the growth that we're seeing.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Mike, anything you want to say on international unit growth pre-FX versus...?
Michael K. Mauler - Executive Vice President and President, Gamestop International
Yeah. I think what we're seeing is pretty strong software growth on new releases, especially new IP. We talked about that a little bit on the call. And so when we look at reservations for the big titles this fall, we're continuing to see that trend where some of the new IP that's coming onto the new gens, there's really a lot of customer excitement around it.
Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
I thought you'd given us in the past the actual – the year-over-year growth on new generation software titles. Is that something – and if you had, what was that number here in Q2?
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
The number in Q2 was 64%. This is U.S. numbers. So 64% for the PS4 and Xbox One and down 56% on the PS3 and Xbox 360. So clearly the one thing that is different in this launch cycle versus the other is the fact that PS3 and Xbox 360 have fallen off faster and we've said that multiple times. So what we're seeing is very robust sales of PS4 and Xbox One offset by accelerated decline in PS3 and Xbox 360 on the new side.
Now, the pre-owned side is obviously outperforming that, which is why we actually grew faster than new this quarter.
Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Then the other question with respect to guidance, and Paul, I heard your comments earlier. You've made those comments before about wanting to put numbers out there that are achievable. But EPS beat the midpoint of your guidance here by $0.08. And you're lifting the range, both the top and bottom by $0.03. So there's $0.05 that goes away there. Is that simply GameStop wanting to be conservative or should we read something else into that?
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I wouldn't read anything else into it. I'll let Rob answer the meat of the question. I mean, here's a couple things. There's what 75% of the year is left. A lot can happen in the rest of the year, we don't know. And number two, you told us, investors told us in the survey that we'd done that you want us to set targets we can achieve. So we're trying to set those targets. Rob, what else would you say about it?
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You know the point I was going to make is that we're only a quarter of the way through the earnings for the year and there is a lot to be learned from the titles as they come out this fall. And so we're a little cautious there.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think if what you're worried about is is there a looming digital scenario out there, I would say not one that we know about. That's for sure. But we're just trying to be cautious and trying to manage expectations and serve our shareholders, you know?
Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Well, thank you. And congrats again.
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you.

Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hi, Arvind.

Let's go to Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Hi, Mike.
Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Hey. Hey, guys. Good afternoon.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.
Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
I just had a couple questions. If you look at the collectibles, which is obviously doing well, growing fast. If you look at that in isolation, is the gross margin for collectibles higher than your broader video game business including software and new hardware and pre-owned? In other words, if collectibles continues to grow, is that a favorable long-term trend for gross margin or not? And then my other question was last quarter you mentioned that pre-owned growth would accelerate throughout the year and end up outpacing new software growth by the end of the year. It sounds like that's still the case but just wanted to check back on that.
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Mike, this is Rob. The collectibles category is margin accretive for us on the overall business. So we're very pleased with that. And expanding that obviously will be beneficial to margin as we go forward. In terms of the pre-owned growth guidance relative to new, I think we said both would be mid single-digit growth for the year.
Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. Thanks very much.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Mike.

And now we'll go to Arvind Bhatia from Sterne, Agee.
Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC
Okay. Sorry about that, guys. Congratulations from my side as well.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Arvind.
Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC
Okay. So, I guess, everybody is trying to figure out the back half. Looks like you guys are talking about acceleration. You've got a great lineup. Just wondering if you would maybe quantify a little bit more on the new software side. I think I remember previously you guys had talked about mid single-digit growth in new software as well. I think you confirmed used, but I just want to be sure you're still comfortable with the mid single-digit growth number ex-FX of course. That's my first question.
And then on the used category, I heard you talk about the extra refurbishment costs related to the hardware side and also how the next-gen category had slightly lower margins. And so just your back half guidance on gross margins, I got that, but how should we think about used margins, say, for 2016 on sort of go-forward basis?
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Rob, do you want to take the software question?
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. With respect to new software for the year, we're saying mid single-digits. I will clarify that with continued FX movement, we're saying mid single-digits growth for software, new software and pre-owned before considering currency. The refurb costs looking forward and the next-gen versus prior-gen, I think the point that I would make there is we're not yet ready to give guidance for 2016, but what you can directionally expect as we move through a cycle is the titles within the next-gen age and that gives us greater flexibility with respect to the buy price as well as the retail prices.
Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC
Okay. And then I missed the part, I think, Tony, you mentioned on the Madden bundle, something about the physical bundle was there but not the digital bundle. Can you clarify that again, please?
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Sure. We worked with our partners. Clearly, what took place last year was there were a lot of hardware promotional offers that were given where they were the packed-in digital game and it was packed-in for free. I think we articulated in the first quarter that we have made it clear with our publishing partners that our preference is that we sell – obviously GameStop's preference is to sell things at full price and provide great value for our trade program and that we have physical disks. And so we worked with our partners that there was a channel right offer that had, again, a digital pack-in in it of Madden and we worked with both Sony, Microsoft and EA, with all three of them, and we offered a free physical disk when you bought either a PS4 or an Xbox One. That's the clarification I was making. And then I said that if in fact we do continue – the platform holders do continue to put in free games as promotional items, we anticipate that at GameStop you'll see more physical bundles from third parties as opposed to digital bundles.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
And you know, Arvind, this digital – of course, we've had lots of conversations on these digital bundles and so forth, right, Tony? But...
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think what's interesting to us is that consumers have a pretty strong preference in this and I think we've seen this play out in a variety of ways over the past few years. Consumers prefer those physical bundles because they know that that disk has value in the trading program at GameStop. So we choose not to participate in the digital bundles and Tony creates these promotions with Bob Puzon that are very effective.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Right. And it did not hurt our market share. We actually increased market share on the launch.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah.
Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC
Sorry. Just one last one. The margins on Mobile, Consumer Electronics is up significantly. I think 900 basis points. Did you talk about kind of what was that this quarter?
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I don't think we did. Did we, Rob?
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Well, the driver for that is within the Tech Brands businesses. As we continue to grow the AT&T-branded store counts and those businesses mature, we're continuing to see rich margins in there that stem from the consumers' shift to the next program from AT&T. So we're very pleased with the margin rates and the impact that that's having on the Mobile category as well as the business as a whole.
Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC
Okay, great. Thank you, guys, and good luck for the rest of the year.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Arvind. Are we going to see you this weekend, Arvind, or no?
Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC
Absolutely. Yes.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director

We'll go to Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.
Curtis Nagle - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Great. Thanks very much for taking the call, and good afternoon. I guess, just the first question in terms of looking at the software guidance for 3Q. Are you guys factoring Metal Gear Solid in any way in there? Just given that it's getting pretty phenomenal reviews and it's a pretty established franchise, I'd imagine it's going to be a pretty good game for you. And then just a quick follow-up.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Yes. We are factoring that in and excited about it. It should be noted also, Rainbow Six did move out of the quarter as well, so we're excited about both of those titles. And so you had – we see that as a trade-off.
Curtis Nagle - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Just going back to the used. So I understand that it was driven by next-gen, but could any of it also have been driven by the fact that the title line-up for this quarter was a little light and maybe you had some people, I guess, value-based gamers shifting into used as a consequence?
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I think as Rob shared, a lot of that, I think where you saw that, Curtis, was in our strong hardware performance and accessory performance. That's exactly what you saw, is you saw more people skewing our pre-owned business towards the hardware side. And as Rob talked about, we have refurb costs which are typically the same year-over-year at a slightly lower retail.
Curtis Nagle - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thanks very much. And good luck for the rest of the year.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Curtis.

We'll go to David Magee with SunTrust.
David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Yeah. Hey, guys. Good afternoon.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, David.
David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Hey, just a couple of questions. One is, given the strength in the hardware cycle thus far, what's your current thinking with regard to the duration of the cycle, how it sort of plays out the next couple of years? And also any color about the tie ratios as well would be helpful. Thank you.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's a great question. Hardware strength and how long – I mean, it's an interesting question, right, because we obviously accelerated, brought forward a bunch of demand. The question he's got is how long will this last?
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Well, we see it continuing. I mean, this continues to grow in strength. And I shared earlier about tie ratio that when you combine our physical tie ratio and our digital tie ratio that we're fairly comparable to the prior launch. And we have tremendous strength as we talked about. What's happening is now we're selling the 1 terabyte hardware, which is creating an additional demand. So we see continued demand. Mike, you might want to share some of PowerUp Reward numbers on continued demand.
Michael K. Mauler - Executive Vice President and President, Gamestop International
Sure.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
It's probably the best indicator we have.
Michael K. Mauler - Executive Vice President and President, Gamestop International
Sure. Yeah. I would say number one, we're still pretty early in the cycle. The last one has gone, what, seven years in most cases. And we're barely two years into it. I think we're seeing an acceleration on the software side in terms of the installed base is growing. You're seeing more and more new IP coming out. And then on the PowerUp side, one of the things we continue to track is PowerUp numbers interest in purchasing new hardware. And those numbers are still very strong and similar to what we reported in the past. So all of our indicators are positive. The consumers are still very excited about these products. And there's a ton of consumers out there who still want these new consoles who haven't bought them or haven't been able to afford them yet.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
And remember that some of the strongest multiplayer games are ahead of us. So Black Ops III, when you look at Battlefront, Star Wars, those are incredible multiplayer games. And that is going to drive whole guilds to go and migrate to a new platform. So we see that – that really has not started to take place in earnest yet. And we think this fall that will start to take place in earnest.
David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Thank you. And then secondly, can you talk about the breakdown in the pre-owned business between what we consider a traditional pre-owned product versus the newer value product?
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
We had $41 million worth of value product this quarter, which was an increase over last year that we had. So it continues to drive – that's what our purchases were for the quarter. And so we continue to increase value offerings as well, so that contributed to some of our growth as well.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I haven't checked the – the goal, David, of the value, if you remember, the value introduction I think it was in the March call last year, right? The goal of the value product was to increase our market share in titles below $20. That's our traditional weakness on the new software side. I think we did that in the first quarter. Second quarter, I'm ashamed to say I haven't checked, but I suspect we probably increased that. It has not been as fast as we had hoped and that's partly because we're just struggling to get to some of those publishers. On the other hand, there's a lot of activity in that space by us intent on purchasing more value product. So I think you'll see more on that.
David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Okay. Great. Thanks, Paul, and good luck.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, thank you.

We have time for two more questions. We'll go next to Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Great. Thanks very much. Nice quarter, guys.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Seth.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Couple of quick follow-up questions here. First on the Tech Brands business, just wondering if you could talk about how those stores are comping, those that have been opened for 12 months or however you disclose it. And then also the operating earnings performance of that business this quarter, I think you gave us revenue, but I'm not sure if I heard the actual operating earnings.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Guys, what can we disclose on that? You got to be careful here.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
In terms of the revenue performance on a per-store basis, Seth, it is not included in our comp number. And the reason for that is because historically the wireless retail business is subject to a lot of volatility that's driven by changes in the commission and compensation structures that the carriers put in. We did a little bit of research as we said before in terms of what companies were public in this space. I think there aren't any left. They've been acquired. And the practice is to not disclose those comps, rather to talk in terms of – for us, the growth in profitability and growth in the store base, I think is a significant thing. Not sure we disclosed the operating earnings number for the quarter. And I don't have that immediately in front of me, so we'll have to get back to you on that one.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I mean, I think the thing you've got to understand is we've got partners there who have rules about what they want to disclose. The Mobile segment, though, I think is a good proxy for – of course, we don't have operating earnings right now in the Mobile.
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
That will be in our 10-Q, Seth, I apologize for not having that (52:04).
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. No. Fair enough. I mean, clearly, that part of the business is in investment mode. We saw that last quarter and again this quarter. How do you think about the normalized operating margins for that business and when that will actually start to inflect positively following this investment period?
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, as Tony and I both mentioned in slightly different ways in our scripts, we expect the third quarter profit to be comparable to last year's operating earnings for Tech Brands. We will continue, as we're opening 90 stores to 100 stores this quarter, to incur some of those infrastructure costs to prepare for those openings. But in the fourth quarter, we think we're going to be largely past that. And we expect that the profit will grow significantly from last year. I think Tony said ex those infrastructure investments, we would expect the Tech Brands' profit for the year to be 40% to 50% up from last year in terms of operating profit margins. Rob, you might want to give them the long-term forecast that we've provided investors before for Tech Brands.
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. That is – I don't have that slide in front of me. But if I remember correctly, it was approximately $170 million in operating earnings against a revenue base of about $1.5 billion. So, in excess of 10% operating margin in that space.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Which would be accretive to us.
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Obvious, yes...
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Traditional operating margins.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up question on the used game business, I think earlier you disclosed kind of a breakdown between current and last gen performance for the new software business. Last quarter you talked about that for the pre-owned business. I'm just wondering if you could give us some color on that this quarter.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. There's a slide on this one, by the way, Seth.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Actually...
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Did we take it down? Oh, sorry.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Took it down last quarter.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Took down the slide?
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, 64% new software growth in PS4 and Xbox One, 117% pre-owned software growth, so significantly increase there. And then, on Xbox 360 and PS3, as I shared earlier, new software was down 56%. Pre-owned software was only down 25%. So we continue to see outpacing and a less decline in the pre-owned section than we do in the new.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. And just, one follow-up, if I may on the pre-owned business, GameStop put out a survey this quarter in a press release discussing how consumers were leaving some money on the table by not trading more games in. What's the company doing to stimulate that trade-in? Is increasing the trade-in values one option to sweeten the deal and drive that trade?
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure it is. I mean, I think Tony had in his script our inventory level. And trade has gone up, right?
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. So, our inventory levels very strong up 6%. And we've done that without having to pay more for the games. So that's been – obviously that's been a good opportunity for us. It is a constant awareness game.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
And that's a debate.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
And that's where PowerUp Rewards is helpful and so forth. And part of the survey, to be candid, was to allow people to understand that if you go into our stores today you will find that we've just kicked off another Trade More, Save More campaign where each store will have the top trader of the week listed, where there'll be top trade values listed. So I think this is a blocking and tackling issue in our stores where will we constantly be working to educate the customer on the great trade values that we have.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
The issue is, the debate here around here – if you Seth, if you're in our offices every day the constant debate is trade values versus new launches that drive trades versus marketing.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Right.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's kind of the big three. And what we found and we can get proven wrong, what we found is big launches and in-store execution drives trades more than trade values. Mike, you want to?
Michael P. Hogan - Executive Vice President, Strategic Business and Brand Development
Yeah, I would just add to that from a consumer standpoint to Paul's point, it's value and awareness. We made a huge step last year with our simplified trade pricing and what we found is that consumers responded extremely well to that. And with a lesser mix of promotion and a greater mix of everyday value, people really responded well to that. And then the other thing that we find is that trade awareness is still always an opportunity. And every time we have an opportunity we want to communicate that and every time we communicate that we bring new people in. And all the evidence we have suggests that when we make people aware of the trade values and what they can get, they respond very positively to it. So we'll continue to work on awareness.
Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah. Okay. Thank you for all the color. I appreciate it.
Michael P. Hogan - Executive Vice President, Strategic Business and Brand Development
Thank you.

We'll go next to Scott Tilghman from B. Riley.
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Scott.
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
I just have a few, I hope relatively quick, questions. First off on the collectible side, as you gear up in that category and have a little bit of history with it, do you expect it to ultimately be lumpier than new content sales or do you think you have an opportunity to provide some smoothing of the revenue with merchandising within the category?
Michael K. Mauler - Executive Vice President and President, Gamestop International
Yeah. This is Mike Mauler. I think that what we'll see, because it's a broader range of IP, we will see it to be smoother. So you're consistently having new movies, new television shows and video game launches throughout the year. And so, for example, the movie launches in the summer, there's frequently not a lot of new releases on video games, but there's a lot of Loot you can sell with that new IP. So it seems like it'll be more consistently strong.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think the fact that you're seeing us outperform in the second quarter indicates how the Loot is really contributing to balancing our demand flow. And as Mike said, there's a lot of IP that's not video games, so...
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Right.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
...it should.
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
And I assume that you will be following up with marketing support behind that as the collection grows?
Michael P. Hogan - Executive Vice President, Strategic Business and Brand Development
Absolutely.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
We hope so. I'm looking at Hogan. He's shaking his head.
Michael P. Hogan - Executive Vice President, Strategic Business and Brand Development
I'm nodding. I'm nodding.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
You don't have a big checkbook but he's nodding.
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Second on international. I missed a couple of the comments. I know Australia was up over 10% on a comparable basis. And if I heard that correctly, that means the other markets, Europe and Canada, were down. I was wondering if you could compare and contrast a little bit what you're seeing across the international geographies.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Want to take that, Mike?
Michael K. Mauler - Executive Vice President and President, Gamestop International
Sure. Just a second.
Robert Alan Lloyd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, I'll go ahead and give the comps. The Canadian comp was 8.5% and we were down in comp in Europe 3.8%. As far as color, I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Mauler - Executive Vice President and President, Gamestop International
Yeah, I think the color would be our two strongest markets have been Australia and Canada. In Europe last year we had very good hardware allocations and Europe really exceeded the rest of the international markets in terms of hardware sales. This year we're back closer to our normal market size on hardware and so that was a little bit of headwind for them.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
One thing to add, Mike, maybe might be that the concept of Loot appears to be more of an Anglo, maybe Northern European concept. Southern Europe, we haven't seen the kind of results that we've seen maybe in some of the Northern European markets.
Michael P. Hogan - Executive Vice President, Strategic Business and Brand Development
Yeah, that's true. The growth of Loot in Australia, Canada, United States, Northern Europe, the Nordics, and Ireland have been consistently ahead of what we've seen in Southern Europe. And so that's something we continue to have to explore.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. We may not have the right assortment yet.
Michael P. Hogan - Executive Vice President, Strategic Business and Brand Development
Yeah.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's one possibility, but we certainly have work to do.
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
That's helpful. The last question I have, just in terms of the competitive environment, you've had some smaller regional players pull out of the category. It seems like some of the big boxes even have diminished the importance of CE as a leading category or a traffic driver, but I'm curious what your take is on the competitive environment both domestically and abroad.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
For video games or Loot or?
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
For the broader product mix.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I'll let these guys add their comments. We've been watching all of these players around the world for a long time and I can't say I've seen much diminishing of anything they're doing. I mean, they're all running their play. That's why I did have a good number yesterday. It appears I haven't seen the video game comps. Have you seen them, Tony?
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
No.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'd be surprised if they really gained a ton of share, but we don't see a huge amount of activity. Our competitor base is so broad now too. It used to be we'd get on a call and we'd talk about Walmart and Best Buy and Media Markt and Saturn and JB Hi-Fi, Amazon. Today we talked about lots and lots of other people, digital players, publishers who are trying to going direct versus through retail. So I have not seen a ton of activity here that's new other than the (01:01:30) players. Tony?
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I don't see a lot of change and actually I think that there is a – we continue to gain market share and so like we say quarter-in and quarter-out, we're selling over one-half of the games. We have made a very distinct effort to try and win this console launch. We've been very clear about that for the last two years and I think we've been effective in that. So I'm sure that there are people at some of those other locations that Paul mentioned that are seeing a significant reduction. I mean, the whole category has not tripled the sales of PS3s and the whole category has not nearly doubled Xbox One. So clearly it's taken a lot of share from a lot of those other people. So I don't think that they're trying less. I just think that we're running on play and it seems to be working.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
On the – guys, we should talk about on the Mobile Loot side. There's a whole new cast. We are a committed AT&T partner, so we are in partnership with them. We compete directly with Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile and we sort of live and die by those fortunes. On the Loot side, there's probably a lot of players on the Loot side. I don't have share data on Loot unfortunately, but I suspect we're growing very fast on share data on Loot.
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Paul, to your point, I assume installment billing is actually a benefit to you given that some of the others out there competing can offer it.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think that's accurate. That's accurate. And there's just a lot going on under one roof. Don't forget, we also offer Cricket in 2,000 stores or so. So 2,000 GameStop stores we will sell you a Cricket prepaid, owned and a contract. So when you can do prepaid phone in a store, you can probably do some other prepaid thing, so we're exploring that very aggressively. It's just a lot – as I said in my notes, I mean, there's just a lot going on here and we don't have the luxury of slowing down. Maybe today it feels less scary, but there was a time here where we were coming in everyday figuring out how we're going to get through the day and so forth. Today fortunately I think we're past that, but we can't slow it down.
Scott Tilghman - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. Well, thank you for taking the questions.
Julian Paul Raines - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.
Tony D. Bartel - Chief Operating Officer

These and other forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
For a discussion of these risk factors, you should review the forward-looking disclosures in the earning release we issued today, as well as the risk factors and other disclosures in OmniVision’s SEC filings and reports, including the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and recent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
During today’s call, we will also discuss certain GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the latter of which exclude stock-based compensation expenses and related tax effects. Reconciliation between the two measures is available in our earnings release posted on our website.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Shaw Hong. Shaw?
Shaw Hong
Thank you, Anson. Welcome to all of you joining us on the call and webcast. Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release describing our results for fiscal Q1 2016. We reported fiscal Q1 revenues of $330 million, an increase of 15.4% sequentially, but a decrease of almost 18.9% year-over-year.
During the quarter, we shipped 215 million sensors. On non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 23% and net income was $28.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Our cash and short-term investments increased again when compared to last quarter at approximately $594 million. We are pleased that these results were consistent with our expectations, despite the fact that demand from our end markets especially China had been fairly volatile.
Before I discuss our business and long-term strategy, I would like to first comment on the status of the acquisition by the consortium that consist our Hua Capital Management, CITIC Capital, and GoldStone Investment. At the end of April, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to be acquired by this consortium. Under the terms of the agreement, the consortium will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company in cash at $29.75 per here, or a total of approximately $1.9 billion.
Our Board of Directors unanimously concluded that this arrangement is the best way to maximize value of our stockholders, providing them with immediate cash value for their investment. Subsequently, we filed a proxy statement with the SEC in June and held a special stockholders meeting on July 23, relating to the proposed transaction.
Our stockholders have voted favorably on the transaction and we are proceeding with our plan to meet the closing conditions in the definitive agreement. Last week, we have also entered into an agreement with TSMC to sell them our equity interest in VisEra and XinTec. The object of this divestiture is to obtain clearance approval and applicable law in Taiwan for this proposed transaction.
Currently, we expect the transaction will close in the third or fourth quarter of this fiscal year. However, the transaction is still subject to regulatory approvals, including antitrust review in the People’s Republic of China, review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., clearance or approval under applicable Taiwan law, and other customary closing conditions.
As of today, we have not obtained all the necessary approvals, nor have we met all the closing conditions. As such, there’s no assurance that the proposed acquisition by the consortium will close.
With that said, I will now comment on our business and strategy. We are celebrating our 20th anniversary this year. During this past 20 years, we have seen the coming to dominance of CMOS as a technological basis for image sensors and the exploding of the imaging market. But in this ever-changing market, we have maintained the three fundamental pillars of our strategy.
First, growing our technological capabilities and developing innovative applications. Second, identifying and capitalizing our market opportunities. And third, optimizing and diversifying our supply chain. With these long-term business strategies, we aim to achieve profitable revenue growth and continue to be the premier business partners for our customers.
First, our technological capabilities. Through years of measured and a disciplined approach to growing our R&D capabilities, we have built a solid foundation to help us lead the way in bringing more innovations to the image sensing industry. On the one hand, we are introducing the latest advancement in fabrications and design capabilities into our product to further shrink the pixel size.
For example, we recently introduced our first 1 micron pixel sensor last quarter, and it was very well received by the market. Concurrently, we’re also identifying more advanced features typically found only in digital still cameras and integrate them into our offerings. For example, we introduced face detection autofocus to a 13-megapixel product, allowing even mainstream smartphones to have a capability that rival that of dedicated point-and-shoot DSCs.
For adjacent technologies, such as ASIC, ISPs and LCOS, we are also making great progress in bringing out new products based on these technologies. We will continue to strengthen our product line up in this area and introduce to our customers an even broader menu of imaging solutions.
Last year, I also talked about forming more technology partnerships as a way to speed up the introduction of innovative solutions to our target markets. In fiscal 2016, we are continuing that push. Most recently, we came up with industry veterans to introduce precision camera solutions for the medical market. We will continue to seek out suitable technology partners and explore new innovations.
Next, our market opportunities, as always we want to continue to expand our business in all of our target markets. The number of mass market applications using image sensors continues to grow at a tremendous pace, creating new opportunities for OmniVision every day. For the global smartphone market mobile phone continues to be a solid market for OmniVision. As I have mentioned before the Asian market, particularly China, has been quite volatile. And it is still difficult for us to determine the seasonality pattern of our business, especially with our business mix shifting towards this part of the world over the last few quarters.
Nonetheless, we believe that the long-term outlook for this end-market, particularly for mid-tier to entry level smartphones remains very positive. Other imaging markets such as India are also increasing their demand for mobile phones. We will continue to invest in China and other emerging markets to realize their longer-term potential despite near term volatilities.
For the entertainment and notebook markets, in the first fiscal quarter of 2016, business in these target markets remains slow. However, there will soon be an entire new class of entertainment products coming to the market, mostly based on 3-D imaging and other wearable concepts. The notebook market will also see new opportunities as the operating system goes through another major upgrade this year. These developments can have potential upside for us and we are prepared.
For the automotive market, our automotive business continues to grow at a very fast pace. It actually surpassed entertainment and notebook last quarter in terms of revenue contribution. We are reaping benefits from our design-win pipeline that we built up a few years back and are shipping at very healthy volumes to various applications designed for driver assistance. We are now extending our design-win pipeline with machine-vision based applications, such as land departures and road-sign recognition.
We will begin to ship against these design wins in the near future. Overall, we expect automotive to continue to be accretive to our revenues and gross profit.
For the emerging market, I briefly discuss our security camera business last quarter. It is riding the wave of new application introductions for smart homes and Internet of Things. We saw significant growth in this space in the first quarter for fiscal 2016. Earlier, I’ve also touched upon our partnership for medical cameras. We have every intention to grow our medical business. With our partnerships, we are in a great position to further drive the adoption of seamless image sensors in this market.
Lastly, our supply chain, yet again, we delivered a solid quarter with sequential improvement in gross margin. This is our 11th quarter with a sequential margin improvement. Our ability to leverage the different capabilities of our supply chain partners and work together to drive production efficiencies played a big role in our continuing margin improvement. From the capacity perspective, our diversified supply chain has the capability to meet today’s market demand.
However, we are of a belief in the long-term growth trend of our business, we’re also working with our supply chain partners to make sure we can meet future requirements. Having said that, we’re closely monitoring the near-term volatility, particularly in China, and we may adjust our plan accordingly.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Ray, who will update you on our sales and the marketing activities.
Aurelio Cisneros
Thank you, Shaw. We are pleased to report that our fiscal first quarter revenues were well within our guidance. In our first fiscal quarter, we shipped 215 million units, as compared to 180 million units in our prior quarter, reflecting strength in our mobile market and strong growth in our automotive and security markets.
The average selling price in our first quarter was $1.53, as compared to $1.59 in our prior quarter. The decrease in ASP was attributed to the combination of the product mix shift towards lower ASP products for the same resolution, and the market price erosion in our largest regional market of China.
Unit sales of 8-megapixel and above represented approximately 19% of total shipments in the fiscal first quarter equivalent to the prior quarter. Unit sales of 3 to 5-megapixel category represented approximately 40% of total shipments, as compared to 38% in the prior quarter for the same category. Unit sales of 2-megapixel and below represented approximately 41% of total shipments, as compared to 43% in the prior quarter.
In terms of target markets, our mobile phone sales represented approximately 65% of revenues in the first fiscal quarter, as compared to 69% in the prior quarter. Our automotive segment represented 10% of sales, as compared to 9% in our prior quarter. Quarter-on-quarter, the automotive market showed a robust 25% growth.
In our emerging market category sales, predominantly composed of the security market, represented 12% of sales, a solid increase from our prior quarter 9%. Quarter-on-quarter, the security market grew by 49%, a significant step up.
Our entertainment segment represented 9% of sales, as compared to 8% in our prior quarter. Quarter-on-quarter, the entertainment segment saw solid step up predominately due to the extension of a customer product SKUs into tablet segment and some incremental upside seasonality in our gaming segment. Our sales of sensors into the notebook and webcam segment were approximately 4% of sales, as compared to 5% in our prior quarter.
In the mobile market, China, which is our largest regional market saw robust growth quarter-on-quarter. Competitive smartphone OEM landscape drove a brisk summer seasonality period. The majority of our shipments to the China market were 5-megapixel, 8-megapixel, 13-megapixel, and 2-megapixel for the mainstream smartphone segment.
Our PureCel products continue to ramp in the China region, offering our customers a migration path to high resolutions, while maintaining equal form factor footprints. For example, our dominant 1/4-inch 5-megapixel product line partially transitioned to our new PureCel 1/4-inch 8-megapixel. Similarly, our third-inch 8-megapixel market partially transitioned to our new PureCel third-inch 13-megapixel products.
In the 5-megapixel category, our new PureCel fifth-inch 5-megapixel offers a cost-effective midrange resolution sensor in a small form factor. We have also engaged with key China Tier 1 OEM brand names to accept our next in line 1 micron pixel technology offered in 16-megapixel product. This is a key milestone in our technology roadmap plan to migrate our key customers to our latest technology platforms. The 1 micron pixel is another step in our interest to extend the gap between our position and the rest of the competitors. So far early feedback of this product from our customer base is very encouraging.
We made progress in the mobile market in other regions as well. In North America, we scored a significant customer with an android-based product line, using our slightly bigger pixel in a 16-megapixel sensor. In Korea, we continue to pull in more socket design wins for our current Tier 1 Korean smartphone OEM customer.
In Japan, we scored new design wins with Tier 1 brand name Japan handset makers. Overall, our mobile market business is in the direction of achieving a balanced attack on customers, regions, and technologies.
In our entertainment segment, we saw a slight increase in revenues and shipments due to an extension of one of our customers tablet products skews, utilizing some of our legacy sensors. We also saw a slight increase in shipments to some of our Tier 1 customers in desktop gaming products lining up their products for the holiday season.
One fast emerging category is the virtual reality or augmented reality headsets being designed by a vast variety of brand-name OEMs or high potential startups. This category has a broad scope of applications from entertainment, gaming, education, industrial, enterprise, or simply web surfing. We have begun shipping early mass production volumes to a Tier 1 brand-name customer, utilizing our highly specialized global shutter sensors. We are also engaged in several other virtual reality and augmented reality, headset potential applications and designs.
The automotive market continues to grow at a steady pace with design wins and shipment ramp ups occurring across the board for Tier 1 OEMs in Europe, North America, Japan, and China. We continue to solidify our number one position in surround view camera systems in the marketplace. A highly acclaimed European brand name has started a surround view camera system production ramp using our latest best-in-class, high dynamic range 1-megapixel sensor, the OV10640. This is the world’s first BSI-based automotive sensor delivered to the marketplace and will set the benchmark in the SVC category.
The previous 1-megapixel SLC high dynamic range sensor, the OV10635 continues to increase in volume shipments against design win secured after two years ago. This points out the key aspect of the automotive business of long-term product life cycles and dependable revenue and profit streams. Our high sensitivity VGA analog-based sensors also continue to ramp up in larger quantities, as design win secured previously start to ship in many regions.
One special category quickly accelerating in usage is e-mirror applications. Early examples on the road exists today, showing the replacements of traditional rear – side view mirrors replaced with an electronic display produced by a camera solution. The benefits are significant, such as wider field of view, blind spot coverage, enhanced dynamic range and even better fuel efficiency due to removal of a traditional bulky side view mirror.
OmniVision’s unique high dynamic range technology incorporate into our automotive sensors, in particular, our OV10635 and OV10640 gives us a significant advantage. We have secured multiple design wins in this category and brand name automotive models will roll out in the near future.
My final discussion on automotive is the category we call Machine Vision. This is CMOS image sensors used in complex camera systems devoted to interpreting the image data captured, not for display image, but to use the information captured to assist in driving the automobile. These are cameras typically pointed forward to assist, or alert the driver and the ultimate goal is use these systems to develop to the autonomous driven vehicle.
In fact, similar to the NHTSA-approved legislature, the imposed backup image solutions required in all vehicles by 2018. Similar legislature is being considered to require automobiles to carry forward front-facing machine vision systems. At OmniVisions due to our unique automotive sensor technologies, we believe we are gaining market leadership in this category. We have secured multiple design wins with either Tier 1 system integrators, or ecosystem partners.
The OV10642 the sister product to the OV10640 is gaining significant traction in the application. Our emerging market category is predominately driven by the security market. Quarter-on-quarter, there was a significant growth. We anticipate continual strong growth. Fueling this growth is a rapid migration to IP camera platforms and the ease of use for domestic or small business setups.
Additionally, security installations represent the next source of cloud-based service and data mining revenues for high-profile Internet service providers. Our shipments in the security market range from 5-megapixel down to VGA with the sweet spot in the 1080p, 720p, and our specialized 4-megapixel sensor that offers high dynamic range and superfast frame rate speeds.
Now, I will comment on some products and technologies recently announced by OmniVision. In the past fiscal quarter, we announced the release of our latest PureCel based product with the enhanced autofocus technology known as phase detection autofocus, or PDAF. This will give DSLR autofocus functionality to one of our most popular mainstream sensors and a compact 1/3-inch 13-megapixel resolution.
We recently announced our next generation 720p sensor for the notebook market, the OV9734. This product is our smallest 720p sensor utilizing our PureCel 1.4 micron technology platform to offer high performance in a small 1/9-inch form factor. The product is targeted to the notebook market or slim smartphone ID designs.
A final announcement to discuss is our latest medical product release called the OV6946. This sensor is based on a reliable OmniBSI+ technology in one of the smallest form factors of 1/18-inch. This allows incredibly small endoscope products to be designed and for added value in the medical industry for many minimal intrusive procedures.
We are to engage in multiple Tier 1 medical OEM customers who are highly motivated to utilize this product. As the automotive market incubated several years, the medical field is similar. We believe the medical industry will generate high barriers to entry type business with attractive return on investments.
In summary, we continue to produce a broad range of products to cover valuable mature markets, as well as highly anticipated emerging markets.
Shaw Hong
Thank you, Ray. I will now turn the call over to Anson, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance and provide guidance for our second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Anson Chan
Thank you, Shaw. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we are reporting revenues of $329.9 million, an increase of 15.4% on a sequential basis, but a decrease of 18.9% on year-over-year basis. Direct sales to OEMs and VARs accounted for 69.7% of our revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. It decreased from 76.5% in the prior quarter.
The remainder of our revenues came from sales through our distributor channels. Their proportional increase in distributor sales when compared to the prior quarter was driven by an increase in the use of distribution channels in our China market. Our fiscal 2016 first quarter gross margin was 22.6% compared with the 22.4% that we reported in our prior quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million included in cost of revenues, our non-GAAP gross margin was 23% compared with a 22.7% in the prior quarter.
Gross margin continued to improve, but the margin improvement was mostly attributable to the net margin effect from the sales of previously written off inventory and allowance for excess and obsolete inventories, which became less unfavorable when compared with our prior quarter. We did experience a small mix improvement in the first quarter, but the associated benefits were more than offset by price erosions which decreased our ASPs.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we recorded approximately $2 million of revenues on a sale of previously written down inventory, an $8.8 million as an additional allowance for excess and obsolete inventories with the net $6.8 million or 2.2 percentage points of unfavorable impact on our gross margin. In compassion in the prior quarter, we recorded proximally $1.6 million of revenues for the sale of previously written down inventory and $10.8 million as an additional allowance for excess and obsolete inventories, with a net $9.2 million or 3.3 percentage points of unfavorable impact on our gross margin.
Overall, our business in China continues to be volatile. Demand for our end-use customers’ products is uncertain and our visibility is reduced as we are further upstream in the supply chains. Combined with the price erosions that we saw in our first quarter and some recent unfavorable exchange rate movements, we are maintaining a conservative stance regarding our own expectations and gross margin trajectory for the rest of fiscal 2016.
R&D expense in our fiscal 2016 first quarter totaled $36.1 million, a 7.9% increase from the $33.5 million in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily the result of our annual companywide salary increase which took effect on July 1, and the increase in stock-based compensation expense in the fiscal first quarter of 2016. We currently expect our R&D expenses in our second quarter of fiscal 2016 to decrease slightly when compared to our first fiscal quarter.
R&D expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 included approximately $4.8 million of stock-based compensation expense. Excluding stock-based compensation expense fiscal 2016 first quarter R&D expense was $31.3 million as compared to $29.5 million in the prior quarter.
SG&A expenses in our fiscal 2016 first quarter totaled $21.1 million, a 10.2% decrease from the $23.6 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is mostly the result of a $4 million one-time charge last quarter, representing success based transaction costs for the signing of the merger agreement with the consortium at the end of April. As an offset, however, our commission payments to channel partners increased in the first quarter, when our distributor sales increased.
We expect our SG&A expenses in our second quarter fiscal 2016 to decrease slightly when compared to our first fiscal quarter in 2016. Our fiscal 2016 first quarter SG&A expenses included approximately $3.7 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Excluding stock-based compensation expense SG&A expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $17.4 million compared to $20.2 million in the prior quarter. The amount of amortization for our acquired patent portfolio remained at $2.3 million per quarter.
Our GAAP operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled approximately $15 million as compared to $4.6 million in the prior quarter. Our GAAP pretax income in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $16.2 million as compared to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As a reminder, included in our fourth quarter pretax income was a one-time gain of approximately $0.6 million related to XinTec completing a stock listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in March 2015. XinTec is one of our equity investees in Taiwan.
Our GAAP tax benefit for the first quarter fiscal 2016 was $2 million, this compares with a GAAP tax expense of $0.8 million in the prior quarter. Included in GAAP tax benefit for the first quarter fiscal 2016 was the reversal of certain previously recorded tax reserves when the statute of limitations for the related tax matters expired. This reversal resulted in a one-time non-cash tax benefit of approximately $3.1 million.
Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP income tax benefit for the first quarter fiscal 2016 was $2.5 million. This compares to a non-GAAP tax expense for the prior quarter of $1.3 million.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect our GAAP income tax rate to be in the mid-teens percentage range. And our non-GAAP income tax rate to be in a high single-digit percentage range.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our GAAP net income was $18.2 million or $0.31 on a per diluted share basis. This compares to $6 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the prior quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects, our non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $28.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share. This compares to a non-GAAP net income of $13.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter fiscal 2016 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $593.8 million, a $69.6 million increase when compared to our $524.2 million balance at the end of our prior quarter. The increase on cash position is primarily related to cash provided by operations. As of July 31, 2015, our inventory decreased to $320.6 million from the $344 million balance at the end of our last quarter.
Our fiscal 2016 first quarter inventory balance represented an annual inventory turn of 3.2 times or 116 days sales from the 2.6 times or 138 days sales in the prior quarter. We are continuing our efforts to reduce our inventory, but given the volatility in our markets, we may likely experience an increase in inventory balance next quarter.
Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2016 first quarter net of allowances were $147.5 million, a decrease from the $151.1 million at the end of our prior quarter. Our days sales outstanding in the first quarter decreased to 41 days from 47 days in our prior quarter. The higher days sales outstanding in prior quarter was attributable to the shipping pattern then, which was heavily skewed towards the latter half of the quarter.
Regarding our class-action lawsuit, in June 2015 the court granted final approval of the settlement and entered a final judgment and order dismissing the action. Consequently, this quarter we reversed the $12.5 million of recoverable insurance proceeds and a corresponding $12.5 million of litigation settlement accrual with no additional cash settlement payment from us and no income statement effect.
Lastly, a couple comments on our equity investees. As mentioned previously XinTec completed its stock listing in the Taiwan Stock Exchange during our fourth quarter. We were required to record the carrying value at its market closing price then, resulting in a tax effected unrealized gain of approximately $37.7 million in the fourth quarter.
As of July 31, 2015, due to a significant decrease in XinTec’s stock price the total amount of unrealized gain decreased to approximately $14.8 million. As to our investment in WLCSP, it too experienced a decrease in stock price, albeit less severe than XinTec. Using the market closing price on July 31, 2015, our WLCSP stake is worth approximately $228.3 million. This compares to our recorded book value of $37.8 million at the end of our first fiscal quarter.
With that I will turn to outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, which ends on October 31, 2015, we currently expect our fiscal 2016 second quarter revenues will be in the range of $300 million to $330 million. Our GAAP EPS are expected range from $0.12 to $0.27 per diluted share. Excluding the estimated expense and related tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, we expect our non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $0.25 to $0.40 per diluted share.
Shaw Hong
Thank you, Anson. From our strategy and execution perspective, we are pleased by the progress we made this quarter. We are as focused as ever in building the business and we believe our growth story remains intact. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill of Needham & Company. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, this is Josh Buckwalter [ph] in for Rajvi. Thanks. Congratulations on the solid results. I was hoping to drill down a little more into the China handset market. I know you mentioned it’s very volatile, but could you maybe talk about the linearity both within the quarter and, I guess, so far in the second quarter? Thank you.
Aurelio Cisneros
If you don’t mind, could you repeat your question? The line we have is little broken up. I just want to make sure I captured the question accurately.
Unidentified Analyst
All right, sorry, is this better?
Aurelio Cisneros
Just speak up as well, that would help.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Sorry about that. So my question was around China handset linearity. I know you mentioned it was volatile, but it would be helpful to get some color both within the current quarter and what you are seeing so far in the second quarter.
Aurelio Cisneros
I wouldn’t – I don’t know what adjective to use, linearity or not. I can tell you right now that the total market is still there and it is still quite dynamic. It’s very competitive, and the total volume is still enormous. What we also see is China continuing to not just service their own domestic demand which is enormous, but also the continual growth of their service to serving emerging markets such as India. And that’s also being driven through the manufacturing structures in China.
The reference to the volatility is just the fact related probably to the financial markets. We are just being a little conservative with the certain recent events that occurred there. I guess, our position is, with those complex events occurring we want to take a conservative position in how it might affect businesses such as the consumer devices that we back into quite heavily into China.
Of course, the good news is China is also picking up on some other markets that we look at as favorable such as the automotive market and the security markets. That is going to help as well. But nevertheless, the mobile handset market is the largest portion right now, still being driven out of China and just all the dynamic events occurring in that market is something we don’t have a full long-term picture for sure not – it’s difficult to predict.
We still believe it’s a long-term good situation to continue investing in, but month to month is sort of what we are concerned about.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thank you. That’s very helpful. And then, I was hoping within the gross margin, you guys have done an incredible job with 11 straight quarters of increasing that sequentially. But it looks like the guidance suggests that might break next quarter, is that accurate? And can you maybe talk about what are the puts and takes within the gross margin? Thank you.
Anson Chan
Similar to what Ray mentioned earlier, in the near-term there are some volatility, particularly in the China market. And we all know about some of these unfavorable exchange rate movements. Even though we trade strictly in U.S. dollars that may translate into some concerns from our OEMs, particularly for those that need to sell their end products in their respective markets in local currencies. Because of these recent events, we have decided to take a more conservative approach in terms of assessing the near-term guidance.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of MelissA - I’m sorry, your next question comes from the line of Mr. Tom Sepenzis of Northland. Please proceed.
Thomas Sepenzis
Hey, thank you for taking my questions. I think – did you say that the ASP for the quarter was $1.03?
Anson Chan
It’s $1.53.
Thomas Sepenzis
53, okay, thank you. And, can you just talk a little bit about what you’re doing? You mentioned LCOS a couple times and I just was curious as to where you are in the development of the product. And potentially anybody that you are working with and in what capacity you might be – would that be for an AR-type headset or are we talking about signage or what are you guys doing in LCOS right now?
Aurelio Cisneros
LCOS represents a very complementary type of business and technology that we could leverage off of our experience in building CMOS image sensors, because it’s all about displaying an image. And it’s all about an array that displays in an RGB pattern, as well as in terms of its packaging manufacturing flow.
That whole business is highly attractive for us to leverage and it backs into potentially common customers, where when we have an opportunity to sell sensors we can sell an LCOS as well. The way it currently stands today, it’s a very, very, very small business. In the acquisition that occurred several years ago. It came with some running business but very minor, very small, and in niche markets and steady markets of LCOS-type traditional applications.
Going forward, you’re right, there’s a million, million different applications that are very attractive and exciting potential for LCOS technologies. Suffice it to say, we are talking to a variety of customers, albeit, most of these projects are, I would say, very emerging as many of new technologies are in development and in early introductions to market places in niche markets.
So that’s all I want to say about our customers and our technologies and our engagements, it’s across the board, heavily engaged with many different customers, and we are searching for the big opportunities.
Thomas Sepenzis
Great. Thank you. And then, in terms of the acquisition, I know you can’t talk much about that specifically. But could you just let us know, are there any – at this point, it sounds like it is mainly regulatory approval from the governments. Are there any penalties for either party backing out of the current offer price?
Anson Chan
If you [ph] look at the agreement itself, yes, there are some penalties involved. Nonetheless, there we are still moving along. There are various regulatory approvals that we still need to obtain. And the closing conditions as listed in the agreement, we are still trying to step through that. Like for instance, we just sent an agreement with TSMC to sell them our equity interests in some Taiwan entities. These are just examples that we’re trying to get through.
We are not expecting any significant change in terms of when we expect the transaction to close, still talking about the fourth fiscal quarter, but there’s no assurance about the close at this point.
Thomas Sepenzis
Great. Thank you. That’s really helpful. And then, last question and I’ll get back in queue. In terms of what’s going on in China, it sounds like there is pretty intense competition on the ASP side and just a general lack of visibility, so you are being quite a bit more cautious here in the near-term. Do you expect to see unit growth continue year-over-year this year and next, or does that flatten out just in terms of a longer-term view with the ASPs eroding so fast, do you still see the units actually growing?
Aurelio Cisneros
I’d like to just make general – very general comments, because there is quite a number of independent third-party reports, any one of us can pick up and read in reference in regard to markets and volumes and prices and resolutions. But the way we see it, China is a enormous engine of manufacturing, obviously, as I mentioned several times for its own domestic sales. But as we are beginning to learn and becoming very evident, it’s the manufacturing platform for emerging regions like India. We expect Africa and we expect Eastern Europe to be part of that process.
So, you look at that situation, the market should continue to grow, although specifically to year-over-year what type of specific numbers that growth will be. I’ll leave it to better experts than myself for predicting the future. We are extremely happy in our position, which engage into this region because of its size and because of its – our ability to grow with it when it needs new technology, new products, and our ability to engage in our sales channels backs into many of our strengths. So, I mean, it’s not something that’s going to go away anytime soon. It’s going to continue to grow and certainly we’re – we want to participate in it for the long term.

Unidentified Analyst
Yes, guys. This is Richard in for Harsh. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to kind of circle up on the China smartphone market. We’ve heard from some other suppliers that there may be some inventory kind of in the channel that needs to be worked down. Are you seeing any signs of this, or do you think it’s purely just you guys being conservative with the volatility in the markets?
Aurelio Cisneros
I can’t specifically say there is inventory right now that we are directly getting feedback. That’s not something I have directly heard through my channels. But we are feeling that there is perhaps in the – I would say the outlook beyond the current quarter, there could be some slowing down of the market. Now what’s causing the slowing down of the market, it could be as – maybe as you are alluding to, perhaps an inventory correction, it could be related to the financial situations in the China market, or it could be related to just market saturation.
As we all know, there has been plenty of events. You could easily read in the news about certain OEM handset makers going through difficulties managing this particular period of intense competitive landscape. So all those combined is something that we are going to all have to filter through and bring back your own interpretation to manage your own business. And that’s something we have to wrestle with every day and that – those are my general comments to a very broad question that you have.
Unidentified Analyst
No, that’s very helpful. And I know that it was pretty broad. And then as you start to look to the India market and some of the other emerging markets in the mobile space, are you seeing those guys transition straight to 4G phones, or are they going to 3G, kind of where are we in terms of that transition?
Aurelio Cisneros
Right. There is a very strong push to go into 4G as quickly as possible. However, the infrastructure, the price points, the configuration of all the handsets that need to be built to provide a 4G phone inside a 4G infrastructure and be able to sell the right volume to the consumer bases all has to be worked out. That’s going to be worked out with the next several quarters. Right now there is still quite a bit of 3G volume, but you are correct. Everybody wants a march to the 4G. It’s going to take a few quarters. That represents opportunity for all of us.
Unidentified Analyst
Gotcha. Thank you very much.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Ms. Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Please proceed.
Melissa Fairbanks
Third time is a charm, I guess. This is Melissa for Hans Mosesmann. Thanks for taking my call. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on your automotive business. What the mix looks like as far as ASP or margin profile relative to the smartphone business? And then again, looking further out into – as you move into Machine Vision, how does that ASP and margin profile change? Thanks.
Aurelio Cisneros
Yes. We – I mean, we won’t be so specific in regards to margin as we don’t break that out for any particular of our segments or business markets. But I will help you out in just letting you know that the automotive market continues to provide double-digit growth quarter-on-quarter. I don’t – I’m not exactly sure how many continuous quarters now we’ve shown double-digit growth, but it’s on a very healthy, healthy pace.
The resolution mix is migrating up, because as we incubated the automotive business for many, many years with simple VGA analog-type high-sensitivity sensors, we are quickly moving into the 1-megapixel for advanced backup cameras and then now a surround view system cameras. Machine Vision cameras are right now in a very, very strong design and engagement with forward-looking 1-megapixel type resolutions now. This all is migrating quickly. Product life cycles are beginning to accelerate now as all OEMs recognize the value of imaging and with the ultimate goal of having a full autonomous vehicle.
So the resolution curve – we see the trend up – going up in resolution, which is very good news, because we do maintain higher profit margin type products in this business. And 1-megapixel is quickly moving into 2-megapixel and then even above the 2-megapixel range. We’ve got engagements with key OEM customers as well as Tier 1 integrated partners. So the whole story of the automotive industry in our business in it is extremely positive.
Melissa Fairbanks
Great. Thanks very much.

Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to the TD Bank Group's Third Quarter 2015 Investor Presentation. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rudy Sankovic, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rudy Sankovic
Thank you, Operator and good afternoon, everyone. We will begin today's presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, the Bank's CEO, after which Colleen Johnston, the Bank's CFO will present our third quarter operating results. Mark Chauvin, Chief Risk Officer, will then offer comments on credit quality after which we will entertain questions from pre-qualified analysts and investors on the phone.

The Bank believes that adjusted results provide readers with a better understanding of how management views the Bank's performance. Bharat will be referring to adjusted results in his remarks.
Additional information on items of note, the Bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to the forward-looking information are all available in our Q3 2015 report to shareholders. With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.
Bharat Masrani
Thank you for joining us today. As Rudy mentioned, Colleen will be up shortly to discuss our results in detail, but let me start by sharing my thoughts. This was a strong quarter for TD. All our businesses performed well. The bank generated EPS of $1.20, an increase of 4% versus an already elevated quarter in 2014. These results were driven by solid revenue growth, good credit performance, positive operating leverage and favorable foreign exchange.
Our Canadian retail segment delivered very good adjusted earnings growth of 8%. We continued to take market share across a number of key categories, and posted a strong quarter for new originations in our real estate secured lending business.
Wealth management achieved double digit earnings growth driven by strong fee based revenues and asset growth. These results reflect the benefits of ongoing investments in this business including the addition of new advisors.
Insurance also had a very strong quarter, as favorable claims performance contributed to good earnings growth. Before I leave Canadian retail, I’m thrilled to highlight a significant accomplishment this quarter. We pride ourselves in providing legendary service across Canada and the U.S. For the 10th year in a row, J.D. Power has recognized TD as the leader in customer satisfaction among Canadian Banks.
For as long as this award has existed TD has won it, and I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of our branch, phone, digital and AT&T including various groups that support this businesses. I also want to thank our customers for their tremendous loyalty and for awarding the industry leader in this important category.
Turning back to the quarter, U.S. retail results were up slightly from Q3 of last year and have increased 5% year-to-date. The business has good momentum, loan growth is strong, we are acquiring customers significantly faster than our competitors and we are making progress on deepening relationships. Our focus on growing the U.S. Wealth business is also going well as assets under management have doubled since we acquired Epiq [ph] in 2013.
Margins have declined this quarter, but we are increasing our net interest income and making good strides on improving our efficiency ratio. Wholesale banking delivered a strong quarter with earnings of $239 million. These results reflect higher trading revenues and investment banking fees and growth in the corporate lending portfolio. We made good progress building out our U.S. franchise adding high quality corporate institutional and government clients and leveraging the deep relationships we have with customers at TD Bank, America’s most convenient bank. This focus has seen strong growth in our U.S. dollar franchise in the last three to four years.
A TD Securities loan book south of the border has been growing at 15% annually since 2013 mainly in high quality investment grade loans. Our government business ranks third globally in terms of raising U.S. dollar funding for its clients and we continue to add franchise building producers across all of our business lines.
On the capital front, our common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.1% remains strong and both our liquidity and leverage ratios are comfortably above our targets. As we look ahead to Q4, we expect that credit losses will remain relatively stable with Q3, and FX will be a positive driver given the stronger U.S. dollar. On the other hand, we expect to see higher expenses and normalization of insurance earnings. Overall, 2015 is shaping up to be good year for TD ahead of our expectations.
Now let me talk a little about the current operating environment and what it means for us. In recent months, we have seen further weakening in economic conditions in emerging markets and downward pressure on commodity prices including oil. The Canadian economy likely contracted in the first half of the year and the Bank of Canada reduced interest rates twice. We are living in uncertain times with increased volatility and financial market turmoil having broader and longer implications.
TD is not immune to these macroeconomic forces, but we’ve had lower risk profile and our resilient business model I’m confident we are well positioned to weather the storm. We get paid to take the right risk and manage those risks and this is exactly what we are doing. Our exposure to oil is relatively small, our underwriting standards remain strong and to date the oil and gas portfolio is performing within expectations and we don’t expect material losses.
We continue to see originations of high quality personnel and commercial loans across our network including Western Canada. We are standing by our customers and clients as they adapt to a new reality. While the U.S. economy also faces uncertainty, the economic outlook is more promising. The U.S. has begun to show signs of recovery and we will benefit from any future rate increases. The housing market, it keeps improving, consumer spending is on the rise in part due to falling energy prices and labor markets are performing well. With this positive outlook, I like the way we are positioned in the U.S. with a young high quality franchise that’s growing and taking share.
I am proud of our performance. TD continues to grow our volumes at a healthier rate and are focus on service and convenience is driving market share increases across our key markets. Our business model has proven to be resilient and we are weathering these conditions well, however, we understand that we can’t rely on revenue growth alone in this environment and we continue to look for ways to make TD the better bank.
Last quarter, we announced the restructuring charge that reflected the first phase of a bank wide focus that will help make us more effective and reduce our rate of expense growth. We are well into the second and final phase and expect to complete most of the work by the end of the year.
As I look forward, our focus on permanently improving our processes will play an important role in enhancing our agility and positioning us for success, but the TD story remains one of growth. I am equally focused on investing in opportunities that will position us for continued out performance in our core businesses. Our leadership team remains resolved to increase efficiency and effectiveness. I am confident that when we are done TD will be an easier place to work and a better bank for our customers to do business with. I’m excited about our prospects and I’m proud of how we are becoming fitter and faster the TD way.
To wrap up, it was a strong quarter for TD. I am pleased with what we have achieved and I have full confidence that we are taking the right steps to preserve our track record of delivering good results and to invest and adapt for our customers, employees and shareholders.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Colleen.
Colleen Johnston
Well thanks, Bharat and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. This quarter we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.20, up 4% year-over-year. The quarter reflected strong growth from retail and wholesale versus last year, up 10% and 11%, respectively. The corporate segment posted a loss of CAD161 million. We continued to benefit from the favorable currency impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
Adjusted total revenue increased 10% year-over-year net of claims or 5.3% excluding FX, led by strong loan deposit and wealth asset growth in addition to higher insurance, fee-based and trading revenue. Growth this quarter was partially offset by margin compression.
Adjusted expense growth was 9% year-over-year or 3.6% excluding FX. Expense growth was driven by increased investment in technology, modernization and new capabilities and regulatory infrastructure partly offset by productivity gains. We were pleased to post strong operating leverage reflecting good revenue growth, positive claims experience and prudent expense management. We remain focused on delivering sustained productivity improvement. Overall, a strong result for the bank this quarter. Please turn to Slide 5.
This slide presents our reported and adjusted earnings this quarter with the difference due to three items of note, which you have seen before. The litigation item reflects the recovery related to certain litigation matters recognized as an item of note in prior quarters. Please turn to Slide 6.
Canadian retail delivered a strong quarter with adjusted net income of CAD1.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. The increase was driven by continued good loan and deposit growth very strong insurance earnings, and wealth asset growth partly offset by higher expenses.
Loan and deposit growth was good this quarter. Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year with real estate secured lending volume up 4%, business lending growth up 9% and auto lending up 17%. Deposits increased by 6% due to strong growth in core checking and savings accounts which were up 9%. Business deposits grew 7%.
Margin declined 1 basis point sequentially primarily due to the impact of a credit mark release in the acquired credit card portfolio last quarter and the lower rate environment partially offset by seasonal factors. For Q4, we expect margins to remain under pressure due to mix, seasonal factors and competitive pricing. 
PCLs increased 4% year-over-year, personal PCLs decreased CAD11 million due mainly to lower credit card personal lending and auto provisions. Business banking PCLs increased CAD20 million year-over-year.
Adjusted expenses were up 4% year-over-year primarily due to higher employee-related costs including higher revenue-based, variable compensation in the wealth business and business growth, partially offset by productivity savings. Canadian retail produced positive operating leverage when insurance claims are netted from revenue. Overall, a strong result from Canadian retail. Please turn to Slide 7.
U.S. retail, excluding TD Ameritrade, posted adjusted earnings of U.S.450 million, up slightly from Q3 of 2014. Results for the quarter reflected strong volume growth and disciplined expense management, largely offset by margin compression and normalizing credit losses. Revenue increased 1% year-over-year as industry leading volume growth and broad based fee growth were partially offset by lower loan margins. Loan and deposit growth remained very strong in the third quarter.
Total loan growth was a strong 11% year-over-year with a 4% increase in personal loans and a 17% increase in business loans. Average deposits increased by 6%. Margin declined 12 basis points quarter-over-quarter, roughly half of the decline was attributable to our U.S. Partner card programs and hedging related items which were offset in other income. The balance of roughly 6 basis points was due to lower loan margins in commercial and auto loans and the impact of the low rate environment on deposit margins. We expect margins to remain under pressure due to continued competitive pricing and the low rate environment.
PCL increased 36% year-over-year mainly due to higher provisions for commercial loans as a result of an allowance built partially offset by a decrease in personal banking PCL. Expenses declined 1% year-over-year due to ongoing productivity savings partially offset by higher expenses to support growth and higher regulatory costs. Our adjusted efficiency ratio has improved by 110 basis points year-over-year.
Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade in U.S. dollars increased 7% year-over-year due primarily to increased asset growth and transaction revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses. Overall, good fundamentals from the U.S. bank which has driven 5% earnings growth in U.S. dollars on a year-to-date basis.
Please turn to slide eight. Net income for wholesale was CAD239 million, up 11% year-over-year, a very strong result. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year, due mainly to higher fixed income and equity trading, M&A fees and corporate lending partially offset by lower equity underwriting fees compared to a strong Q3 of 2014.
Non-interest expenses were up 10% driven primarily by higher initiative spend, the impact of foreign exchange translation and higher variable compensation. ROE this quarter was 17%.
Please turn to slide nine. The corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of CAD161 million in the quarter compared to a loss of CAD53 million in the same period last year. The higher loss was the result of lower favorable tax items in the current quarter and ongoing investment in enterprise and regulatory projects and initiatives.
Please turn to slide 10. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.1% in the third quarter versus 9.9% in Q2. The increase reflects solid organic capital generation partly offset by increased RWA mainly due to volume growth. Both our leverage and liquidity ratios are consistent with last quarter. Overall, we continue to remain well positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark.
Mark Chauvin
Thank you, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 11. While we've seen an in the provision for credit loss of CAD47 million or 12% quarter-over-quarter and CAD114 million or 35% year-over-year, the increase is attributed to the normalization of loss rates in the U.S. portfolio through a combination of increases in commercial and retail allowances to support volume growth, seasonal trends in consumer credit volumes and lower recovery levels as workout activity continues to reduce.
The Bank's loss rate was flat at 33 basis points for the quarter with gross impaired loans stable at 57 basis points, up 1 basis point over the previous quarter and 2 basis points year-over-year.
The oil and gas portfolio continues to perform within expectations and we have yet to see a meaningful deterioration in consumer credit quality in the impacted regions. Oil and gas outstanding exposure remains stable representing less than 1% of total loans and acceptances.
While we continue to maintain a cautious approach across retail and non-retail exposures impacted by low oil prices, I do not current believe that low oil prices will result in a material increase in credit losses. In summary, credit quality remains strong across the bank as we head into the fourth quarter.
With that, operator we are ready to begin the question and answer session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from John Aiken from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
John Aiken
Good afternoon. Bharat in his opening comments talked about TD being a growth bank and I immediately then flipped to the indirect auto growth that you had on both sides of the border. I found that very interesting based on commentary one of your competitors had that they were actually tapping the brake in terms of that loan growth. So Tim, can you let us know what your philosophy is in terms of this portfolio and importantly what you're seeing in terms of some of the longer term lending practices that are going on in the marketplace?
Timothy Hockey
Sure, John, we are actually quite comfortable with this portfolio. We had great growth through the years. The dynamic of course is that the auto sales continue to be strong. Just so we have made some investments in that particular business and we introduced a new system this past spring and so we're seeing some other results of that.
The overall trends, if you worried about at this point of the cycle, we continue to see the call it average credit score in that business essentially flat through the years. We're actually a little bit below industry average when it comes to loan to value on the prime book. We're basically on market in the non-prime book, but we're still very comfortable with this particular business, we think it's an important growth area for us.
Mike Pedersen
John, this is Mike. Maybe I'll comment from a U.S. perspective. This is obviously a category where we continue to see good growth and our new dealer strategy is paying off. We're focused mostly on super prime and prime, little bit of near prime and we've reduced our expense space and both our credit and profitability metrics are improving. And as was the case with Tim's comments on Canada, all of the key risk metrics, the stuff we're writing is better than our portfolio, so it were improving our risk posture in this business as things stand and comfortable with it.
John Aiken
That's great. From a competitive standpoint, though you guys being forced to chase the terms that are being pushed out?
Mike Pedersen
Nor that the case in U.S. in fact, as I alluded to including on term the originating terms are lower than the portfolio terms and they are well within normal risk parameters. We're not chasing the stretchy stuff.
John Aiken
Great. Thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Meny Grauman from Cormark. Please go ahead.
Meny Grauman
Hi, good afternoon. First question, wanted to follow-up on commentary you made. You talked about – you haven't seen any meaningful deterioration in consumer credit quality in affected regions, in oil producing regions. And I'm wondering why you think that is? There are some reasons that you think that this is that that's causing this?
Mark Chauvin
It's Mark. I'll answer that. I think we still feel it's probably early and its probably still to come. You can certainly see in those markets that unemployment is going up. We're just not seeing it translated to our delinquencies yet, but I still think in the next quarter or two that we will see it come in to the levels that we kind of expected when we kind of went down this road.
To put it maybe in the context, we feel that at s $35 oil price, it gradually recovers into the $40s and into maybe $50 over four-year period that you might look for an increase on the direct and indirect which will cover the consumer area of about 5% to 10% per year. So, we think that that's probably likely to come. We just haven't seen yet but we're watching closely.
Meny Grauman
Thanks for that. Then I wanted to switch gears and I think this one for Tim. I just want to ask about the Canadian mortgage market and there are definitely headlines over the past few months about fraud. And I'm wondering from your perspective, how big a problem do you think fraud is in Canada and do you think that there's more fraud going on now in the system than say five years ago?
Mark Chauvin
Yes. It's Mark again. I'll take that from a maybe a risk perspective. We follow in our underwriting standard, verification of income and the down payment is very important and central to the process. So, we will do that through several means and we will do it until we satisfied that we have it right. So it could be tax returns, that could be -- if they're a customer of the bank it would through automatic deposits to their accounts, but would be verification from employers that we would even reach out and call to them, call the employer if necessary. But in addition to that we do have fraud analytics that looks to assess the reasonableness of a declared income to make sure it makes sense.
And my comfort that is working effectively is that we do have a Quality Assurance program that follows up behind. And we even do that for mortgages that we buy from other institute like from other second tier areas. When we buy them we do go and look at it and it's effective in detecting those fraud situations and picking them. And so I'm quite comfortable that we're effectively managing it. We have the proper risk navigation in place. I don't think necessary that it's gone up over time though to tell you the truth.
Timothy Hockey
Meny, if I can just add. I think if you look back to your point five years ago the heighten level of scrutiny on this market both by all of us as lenders as well as regulators, as well as tightened the Ministry of Finance basically in terms of tightening. My sense is if anything it would have gone down little bit and there's certainly higher degree of scrutiny on that type of activity.
Meny Grauman
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Steve Theriault from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Steve Theriault
Thanks very much. If I could start with a couple maybe quick questions for Mark, Mark. So I'm referring to slides 21, 22 in the deck, and maybe it's obvious, but I'll ask anyway. When I look at TD versus Canadian Peers versus U.S. Peers, you have those three tables there. On gross impaired, TD screens quite favorably, on credit provision quite favorably as well. But I look at the formations and may topical given all the questions around credit these day, I notice TD's formation in terms of basis points is higher than Canadian Peers, which maybe isn't too surprising, but higher than U.S. Peers as well. I'm wondering maybe hopefully my questions has been long winded enough to give you a chance to take a look at those and if you can provides some insight as to why that is maybe helpful?
Mark Chauvin
Yes. I mean, the increase in gross impaired loan formations really focused in the U.S. primarily, relatively constant in Canada period over period. And in U.S. what we're working through is in the HELOC portfolio we have two legacy effectively interest only products. One is an evergreen so individual in the HELOC portfolio can stay on interest only payments for an extended period of time when the product was originally sold. And then what we refer to is a 5510 product when means it's got a five-year interest only period followed by another five-year then amortization over ten. And these are legacy products that over the years with the tightening of the underwriting standards these are products that we don't offer any longer.
So, as we go through the portfolio we're renewing these customers and so it's an interest only or we're looking to qualify them under the current standards. And the standards are higher and they're more rigid appropriately so. And so if a customer does not qualify then we're required to designate them impaired. It is a regulatory requirement that called TDRs and they go into the impaired although they are still making their payments. So if you look at the formations for the quarter 90% of those were customers that were making payment as just as they couldn't qualify under the current standards.
And if you look at the overall impaired for HELOC it's about 60% that are currently making their payment themselves. So we've been experience [ph]. We're about a year or so into this process. We feel that we reserve appropriately for those based upon our experience going forward. As U.S economy continue to strengthen we think that these will get better and probably the risk of loss is not – we don't really see it as the high expected loss portfolio, but it will have an impact on impaired formations and gross impaired loan for period of time I'd say for the next three or four years.
Steve Theriault
Okay. That makes sense. It's probably just a much bigger part of your mix than it would be for some of those U.S. comps on the table?
Mark Chauvin
Yes. True. I guess I don't study the others as well.
Steve Theriault
And then a quick for Colleen in Q2 when you announced the restructuring charge, you hinted at a Q4 charge but the work was still being done and may still very well be ongoing, but wondering if you can give us a sense for whether in terms of order of magnitude it will be in similar range or not when we roll around to Q4 in December?
Colleen Johnston
Ho, Steve, the work is still ongoing and I don't have a solid number at this point in the process, but I think we're probably looking at an order of magnitude that's somewhat similar to Q2 charge. Although I would expect at the moment it will be smaller than what you saw in Q2, but more to come in the fourth quarter.
Steve Theriault
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Robert Sedran from CIBC. Please go ahead.
Robert Sedran
Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to come back Colleen to your comments around the U.S. margin, and I make sure I understood them. I guess half that was related to loan and deposit spreads, was any of that mix or is all that just competition?
Colleen Johnston
So, I'll start out and then maybe hand it over Mike to embellish a little bit, so if you look about half the margin decline and we have in the past we've called out the U.S. card partner programs and that can have an effect on the margin and in particular there were some accretion last quarter which didn't recur. And then also we had and I'm sorry to cite accounting movements but I must do so.
We did have shift between NII and other income related to our fair value hedges. So that -- you can see that sequentially that are other income in the in-source currency increased quite a bit. So I'd say, I call about half of the margin decline was related to those two items. And then I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about the relative growth rates in our various portfolios and how that's affected the margin.
Mike Pedersen
Yes. So I think the answer to the question is that it was partly mix. So, the margin did decline a bit more than we expected this quarter, but mostly because we grew faster than we expected and that was especially in larger commercial loans and in super prime auto lending. So, in this environment with origination margins lower than portfolio margins if you're outgrowing the market in lending you are subject to more margin pressure, but it’s still good NII business. And so because we had larger than expected growth in larger commercial loans and in super prime we saw a little bit, so you called that mix, but I would just say that these represent good NII business with good credit quality but lower margins, but you'd want us to do this business and you can see it in our NII, we grew our lending in our revenues increased by CAD60 million quarter-over-quarter.
So our focus is on growing our revenues and profits more than just managing to the NIM target and in the last couple of years we've grown our net interest income faster than our both our big bank and regional bank competitors.
Robert Sedran
And so if I can tie that back to Colleen comments about the pressure to be ongoing, presumably are less than what was shown this quarter?
Mike Pedersen
I think we're hesitant to put precision around this, but on balance I would expect that it's most likely that we'll see some continued downward pressure and that's especially if we continue to see good loan growth or better than market loan growth. I would just add that rate increases would obviously mitigate this.
Robert Sedran
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Mario Mendonca from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Mario Mendonca
Good afternoon. Mark, first could you just explain what you meant by the 5% to 10% increase when you're describing the expected increase in credit losses, do you mean 5% to 10%?
Mark Chauvin
Okay. We run many stress test and looking at the impact of low prices, but if you look at the one that I think that's probably most appropriate that's a $35 gradually increasing as I indicated earlier, and when you look at that the incremental increase due to low oil prices in the direct, so that would be the oil and gas sector, the services sector and the indirect would be largely consumer credit in those regions that are most impacted by low oil prices. We would expect versus current PCL levels an increase in the 5% to 10% per year range.
Mario Mendonca
Annually, so call for the next three years, if that's the way [Indiscernible]
Mark Chauvin
I'm sure, I would go three years, but say per year my thinking is two.
Mario Mendonca
Okay. That's fair. Colleen, the next question I'm going to ask, I've had some varying degrees of success on the calls, but given what Mark's just offered about what seems kind of like a modest increase in PCL. The question I have is in that environment do you think the bank will be capable of growing earnings, even just modestly year-over-year? 
Colleen Johnston
We'll start with Mark, Mark is responsible for all of the stress testing and all of the moving parts and comments specifically on oil and then I'll wrap it up, Mario.
Mario Mendonca
Okay.
Mark Chauvin
So, looking at the view, what is the impact of oil prices to the bank effectively, I mentioned the credit, there's pluses and negative, so the most obvious negative is the credit element which I mentioned, but also in that scenario, we would look forward, reductions in interest rates and we've seen two from the Bank of Canada already that are kind of factored into the analysis itself. And then we'd also look for just revenue reductions due to the lower GDP growth.
But on the other side looking at the positives, the reality is with low energy prices we would expect higher consumer spending in our largest markets being Central Canada and Northeastern U.S. and we would expect those to have stronger growth. And also in that scenario it's really – you would certainly see a low Canadian dollar which we're seeing today and that would have a positive impact on FX translation on our U.S. earnings.
So the net impact of the positives and negatives of our stress testing is kind of a neutral position. So, we feel we're pretty well position to weather this situation given our relatively lower exposure to oil and gas itself plus kind of where our large markets are and couple with U.S operations to arrive at its kind of a neutral impact over that two-year period. So I'll past it over to Colleen.
Colleen Johnston
Yes. Just to conclude, talking about 2016, its still – our planning process is still underway, it’s probably a little early to comment on specifics. But I think if you take Mark's comments and then what I would say is that absent any other shocks we don't necessarily see oil prices impacting our growth trajectory and obviously we are working on productivity improvement which should help us in 2016, so, net-net as they say we would still see some growth.
Mario Mendonca
That's what I was looking for. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Gabriel Dechaine from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Gabriel Dechaine
Hi. Good afternoon. Just two prong on the expense question here. The seasonal increase we, I think you guided to it last quarter that we would still see in Q4 this year, I'm just wondering if we're going to see a similar magnitude of quarter-over-quarter spike as we did last year which was on the high side. And then also on the restructuring charge how many understand the benefit for investors, if it’s not a tangible EPS figure that's going to come out of the cost cutting in this program, like will TD be able to deliver sub 3% growth in perpetuity, something along those lines, I think that could be helpful?
Colleen Johnston
Okay, Gabriel let me start with your first question regarding our Q4 expense increase. So I'm going to give you some numbers here and I'm going to express them on an adjusted basis and I'm going to exclude foreign exchange. So over the past couple of years we've had an average quarter-over-quarter growth in the fourth quarter just over 6%. So this year I do still expect an increase, but I'd be surprise if the rate of increase isn't substantially lower, again in percentage terms in the last two years, but I will caution off the top that based on where foreign exchange rates are going, I think the headline number quarter over quarter will look higher because of FX.
So, on a Q3 year to-date basis are expense again excluding foreign exchange and M&A increased by 3.6% and if I'm right about Q4, this means that our full year expense growth rate will definitely come down from the Q3 year to-date level. So, we're definitely on the case I can assure.
Gabriel Dechaine
That's very helpful.
Colleen Johnston
So to move on to your second question, really the message isn't different from what we told you last quarter. So, if you look at our expenses this year and I just mentioned the 3.6% growth and I'm talking on a year to-date basis now, so I'll just give you some moving parts. So higher project and initiative spend drove about 2% growth in our total expenses and there are base expenses are up on a year-over-year basis as well, and that always have to come in to the picture.
So, we are giving increases to our frontline staff, our business volumes are growing. So that also means that expenses will increase, and then what we're doing, we've been doing for several years and we'll continue to do at a greater rate is then we productivity gains to bring our rate of expense growth down. So this year they say 3.6% and part of that growth by the way is variable cost that's linked to revenues. So that sort of gives you the picture of where we are.
So when you think about as we head into next year, we expect that project and initiative spend really increase, but again we're spending at important areas already this year, but you look things like digital and mobile capabilities, although we're keeping our retail distribution cost in total at a very reasonable growth rate.
Technology, modernization and transformation is really important and that's to improve our agility and to reduce costs. Regulatory infrastructure is an area of spend in particularly on aspects of Dodd-Frank. So, and also as you look to next year we do – the fact that we are increasing our project spend, means, that we will have higher depreciation cost going forward, because some of our project cost are capitalized. We will continue to have base increases going forward and again this for the same that I mentioned just a minute or so ago.
So, then the key is that what do we do in terms of productivity and we got it frankly increase the rate of productivity gains from what I've cited on a year to-date basis and that's where restructuring is going to help us. So the name of the game here is that what we want to do is make sure that we can – that we can slow down our rate of expense growth. You're not going to see a year-over-year decline that just isn't reasonable in this environment, but what we do what to do is reduce our rate of expenses growth, and people ask me what are you doing, that will fall to the bottom, that will fall to the bottom and assuming we obviously what to make sure that we can grow our revenues at a decent rate given the environment. So that how we're thinking about expenses generally.
Gabriel Dechaine
Okay. That's helpful, very helpful. Just a really quick on there. Bharat, you mentioned normalization of insurance earnings, there was big spike this quarter in growth. Was the contribution from which may call the claim -- positive claims development. What was that?
Riaz Ahmed
It's Riaz, Gabriel. I don't think normally disclose that in a quarter-over-quarter basis, but I can say that if you look at the claims number on a year-over-year basis its down quite a bit. So half of that order of magnitude is because of as I had mentioned in Q2, 2015 that we're shedding some low value international activity, and so that's brought our claims cost down fair bit without having any meaningful impact on NIAD and then the other half is in Q2 and Q3 we've had terrific weather, so our claims are down, we're seeing the emergence of some favorable development and then we didn't have any material catastrophes to speak off, so I think that's what causing us to have two very strong quarters.
Gabriel Dechaine
Thank you, Riaz.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Sumit Malhotra from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Sumit Malhotra
Thanks. Good afternoon. Just to share with Bharat since we're there on insurance. Two years ago at this time we had some conversations after the events in Calgary about whether the P&C Insurance business was a good first for TD Canadian retail operations just given some of the consistent volatility we had seen. It's been a much better year from a claims experience perspective; we have just talked about some of the improvements you've made in the business. And it's also been a period where there has been M&A activity in P&C Insurance domestically. Now that the business is fixed up or running better, have you given some additional thought as to whether it is a fit with what you want the brand to be in Canadian retail?
Bharat Masrani
Sumit, yes, the business continues to be core for us, yes, we did have some issues and as you rightly pointed out we fixed those issues. We have adjusted our model to make sure that we take into consideration events like what happened Calgary, so that is part of how we run the business. And frankly we see some synergy and having that TD brand in that business and we can leverage that. And it is a good returning business as we saw this quarter. So overall we feel pretty comfortable with where we are and we will continue to find ways to make sure that we are growing this business appropriately and in a manner that provides us with good returns. But overall very happy with it and it continues to core.
Sumit Malhotra
All right. That's straightforward enough. And then one quick one hopefully for Mark, since your were giving us some color on how you're thinking about the stress test process. If I look at on a year-over-year basis we've obviously seen a significant decline in oil prices yet unemployment on a Canada as a whole basis, the unemployment rate is actually lower. So when you run your stress scenario how are you envisioning the trend in domestic unemployment? And I ask specifically due to the fact that the bank is a bigger domestic credit card player than it was when we have the last credit cycle in Canada?
Mark Chauvin
Well, when we did our low oil price scenario, I mean, we did look at it on a regional basis and our scenario played out that there would be increased on unemployment in those impacted regions in the range of from then existing levels of 40% to 50%. And if you look at the increase in credit losses that I mentioned 5% to 10% that is like two-thirds or largely driven in the unsecured sector which would be cards, I would include indirect auto in that as well. So that's really the major driver of the increase in credit losses versus the direct exposure to the actual oil and gas producers. Our experience in the oil and gas producers has played out very similar to how we projected last January in terms of we have seen negative migration in the portfolio, but we’ve seen – we’ve had no surprises in terms of accounts. The accounts that went down and once we thought would go down. We’ve had four go into impaired status but two of those were paid out relatively quickly and we’ve only got two left in the account at above CAD30 million and actually we’ve seen about CAD400 million or 10% of portfolio payout and it was the higher risk accounts that were refinanced or taken out by acquirers. So yes, the unemployment certainly factored into it and this credit card is a driver but we think it’s well within the range of being – its within what we would have expect or call it our risk appetite.
Sumit Malhotra
And so I just sort of have it right, I may have missed it earlier. When you say 5% to 10% are you talking on a dollar basis on the domestic provisions, 5% to 10% left?
Bharat Masrani
Correct.
Sumit Malhotra
Thanks for your time.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Sohrab Movahedi from BMO Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.
Sohrab Movahedi
Just a quickie for Mike. Are you happy with the performance of the U.S. retail segment in source currency?
Mike Pedersen
Sorry, I didn’t catch the last bit of your question.
Sohrab Movahedi
Just in source currency so avoid negating the effects in fact are you happy with the performance of the segment?
Mike Pedersen
I am happy with our performance in the circumstances that were operating and it’s as difficult in terms of the lower rates and the fitful economic expansion and traction as well as the competition. As I look at the major elements of our performance, we are doing very well versus our end market competitors. We are doing well on earnings. We are doing well on revenues; we are doing well on expenses to have 200 basis points positive operating leverage this quarter is a nice thing to have in this kind of environment.
Our expenses are down for the full year, year-to-date by 1% compared to last year. So I’m happy in the sense that we are outperforming our end market competitors in a very difficult environment. I’m obviously hopeful that we get some assist in terms of the economy and rates but in the absence of that I think we have enough levers at our disposal in terms of deepening relationships with customers and improving our distribution strategy and the productivity agenda that we can continue to generate earnings going forward no matter what the – within reason no matter what the circumstances are and year-to-date our earnings are up 5% I would have taken that at the beginning of the year if you said it was possible.
Sohrab Movahedi
Okay, so just – but just to push on that earlier a bit. I mean it looks like the credit environment has turned way for your portfolio in the U.S. You’ve got some incremental loan losses absent recoveries that’s just going to be there and you were able to offset that with the lower expenses this quarter like year-over-year. If credit continues to you know not deteriorate but at these types of levels trend higher and revenue environment stays such that the best you can do is grow lower margin but higher volume business, how much leverage do you think you have on your expense line to continue to get the bottom line in an around these types of level?
Mike Pedersen
Well I guess I’d say that we understand that in this environment for the reasons that you’ve articulated that we need to be very focused on productivity and expense management agenda and as I alluded to before we are and we have been and we continue to be in terms of its difficult, it’s a little early to look at next year, but I think we will continue to see that expense management will help us moderate that rate of expense growth and our focus is to try to continue to deliver positive operating leverage even as we’re investing for future growth and things like our card business and our wealth business and our technology and digital platforms and so on.
Sohrab Movahedi
Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Stefan [Indiscernible] from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes hi guys, good afternoon and also good evening from London. Two questions, the first one on the U.S. assets, you obviously have been quite interested in buying portfolios, small books etcetera. Could you just give us a little bit about the criteria that you have and the minimum hurdle returns, size etcetera and also maybe a little bit about the type of credits asset that that is card etcetera and is there anything on the horizon right now that could be of interest to you.
And the second question is now that your assets are higher than RBC or I guess some of your other competitors I really should say, have you had any discussions with obviously or with any other regulators in terms of the potential inclusion on the GCC list. You are a significant bank in the U.S. and you are a significant bank in Canada which are obviously two quite important banking systems on a global scale, does that potentially make you a GCC down the road?
Mike Pedersen
So it’s Mike. I’ll take the first part and then I’ll let Riaz take a stab at the second. So I would say that our focus on the U.S. business is on organic growth at this time. As I said before we feel we’ve got lot of levers to pull and that’s our primary focus. We do of course look at things as they come up from time to time and in that respect I’d say we are more focused on potential asset plays in the line of the Nordstrom kind of thing or similar things then we are on for example larger branch based acquisitions, but our focus is on organic growth.
Riaz Ahmed
Stefan, its Riaz. I’d say on the question of becoming a [Indiscernible] as you know both under the BCBS [ph] as well as the U.S. rules the test is a multi factor weighted test of which the balance sheet is only one factor to be considered. So we’ve been in our calculations we’re nowhere near being designated GSIB [ph] or either international here in the U.S.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Doug Young from Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Doug Young
Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been asked, but I guess the one that I was kind of just hoping you could enlighten me on is the collective IBNR did increase I think in U.S. 48 millions and I think that’s different than I think the impact or what caused that was different than what caused the gross impaired loans increased but and I think you refer to it as allowance build. Can you flush that out for me in terms of what that relates to?
Mark Chauvin
Yes it’s Mark. Two factors were driving that, one is as you grow volumes and the U.S. is experiencing good volume growth. You are adding to your reserves and its showing up in the IBNR. And the second area is there is a seasonal mixture to two of the asset categories such as credit cards and indirect auto, which typically in the second quarter or the quarter ending April tend to have an improvement in quality which results in a reduction in your allowances as well as a reduction in volume to payouts. But that naturally comes back in the third quarter and so we’ve seen a – that swing in the third quarter and cards and indirect auto which was really totally within our forecast but it resulted in the increase in the allowance as well as with the commercial side. But it was driven by effectively volume I guess is the simple answer.
Doug Young
Volume, and so this you would expect it to reverse in the next quarter, is that a sense…
Mark Chauvin
Well I think the volume – I would expect it to stay constant to increase with volume, but not to the same extent because the seasonal factor won’t play as much a factor in the next quarter and everything else being equal just it would be in pace with volume.
Doug Young
So this has nothing to do with migration, it’s more of a volume.
Mark Chauvin
Yes, not credit qualities. It would be migration. And so we look at it and we decompose it and it was driven by volume not credit quality.
Doug Young
And then just a second, I guess calling on the set one ratio, do you hedge out your FX risk within the set one ratio or no?
Colleen Johnston
I can turn this to Riaz, but the answer is yes we do.
Doug Young
Yes, okay.
Colleen Johnston
So I just answered this.
Riaz Ahmed
I won’t - get angry.
Colleen Johnston
Riaz, [Indiscernible] luckily.
Doug Young
Thanks.
Colleen Johnston
Yes, we do.
Doug Young

Thank you. The next question is from Peter Routledge from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.
Peter Routledge
Thanks, I just want to come back to Meny's question a little earlier about the mortgage approval process. I’m kind of having a hard time reconciling the diligence you talked about and your peers talked about as well with sort of the service aspiration of turning around approval less than 24 hours. So, what would you say to a skeptic who thought well there’s no way they can hit their service goal and due diligence and there has to be core cutting in their due diligence.
Tim Hockey
Well those are the standards that we actually have negotiated. It’s Tim answering here. What we’ve changed in the last sort of while as we entered into an outsourcing relationship with First National and they have a very dedicated senior lending team. So what we do is we basically have outsourced our adjudication and our funding of the mortgages. They are writing to our specifications. There is no auto adjudication which to your question might impact your turnaround times but we’ve negotiated as part of our pricing the ability to actually get those approval rates back and quickly and we’ve seen a substantial improvement in the turnaround times to the brokers which is one of the reasons why we are up strongly in real estate secured lending. So we’re quite comfortable and given this is a relatively new relationship the oversight that we put in place with the TD folks on the ground is measuring to a brand newly established standard care.
Mark Chauvin
I would only add Peter is that the verification of income or the down payment can occur after the approval. It’s in the fulfillment process.
Peter Routledge
Okay, so you have – you can still improve the conditional approval and then….
Mark Chauvin
The fulfillment is after that and maybe you have to have all that documentation in order to fund and you may identify the problems then and not fund.
Peter Routledge
Okay. And one other question, if despite all this at some point it sounds that a small but productive cohort of third parties have put or submitted mortgages with faulty or misrepresented underwriting data. And if those insured mortgages are sitting on TDs balance sheet, could your mortgage insurers deny the claims on those mortgages even if no TDs employee was directly or indirectly involved in that misrepresentation?
Mark Chauvin
The insurers position, they refer it to as fraud for shelter and that’s where someone may overstate their income in order to get to into a house as long as there has been no employee of the organization involved in that, their position that does not invalidate insurance.
Peter Routledge
Thank you, that’s very clear. Appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to Bharat Masrani for closing remarks.
Bharat Masrani

Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call
August 27, 2015 05:00 PM ET
Executives
Terry Finley - CEO and President
Todd Noden - CFO
Operator
Please stand by, we’re about to begin. Good afternoon and welcome to the Books-A-Million Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Todd Noden, Chief Financial Officer of Books-A-Million. Please go ahead, sir.
Todd Noden
Good afternoon, everyone. With me today is Terry Finley, Chief Executive Officer and President of Books-A-Million. We’re pleased to host this conference call regarding the Company’s second quarter and year-to-date results, which were issued this afternoon.
Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that management’s comments in this conference call which are not based on historical facts are forward-looking statements. It should be noted that the company’s future results may differ materially from those anticipated and discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in periodic reports filed with the SEC.
Next, I will begin this afternoon with a discussion of our financial performance for the second quarter and then Terry will provide a discussion of our current business trends.
At quarter end, we were operating 256 Books-A-Million and 2nd and Charles retail stores and 42 Company-owned and franchised Yogurt Mountain locations. During the quarter, we opened two new traditional stores and closed one traditional store and two superstores. We continue to operate four commercial retail centers within our real estate seg.
Net sales for the 13-week period ended August 1, 2015 decreased 0.8% to $106.8 million, compared with net sales of $107.6 million in the 13-week year earlier period. Comparable store sales for the second quarter decreased 0.3% compared with the same period in the prior year. Other revenue, which is comprised primarily of real estate rental revenue, increased 62% to $1.2 million. This increase is due to the year-over-year expansion of our real estate segment.
Gross profit, excluding other revenue as a percentage of net sales after occupancy cost and warehouse operating expense during the second quarter, was 27.1% compared to 28.1% last year. The decrease was due to lower gross profits resulting from higher markdowns and discounts. Operating, selling and administrative expenses increased $2.5 million during the second quarter compared to Q2 fiscal year 2015.
This increase is due to higher administrative cost in connection with Go-private [ph] initiative and higher Books-A-Million retail labor expenses which were offset by lower new store opening in corporate payroll expenses. As a percentage of total revenues; operating, selling and administrative expenses for the second quarter were 28.9% versus 26.5% last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $476,000 to $3.9 million in the second quarter from $4.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Decrease was due to historical reduction in retail operations capital expenditures, partially offset by the addition of long-lived assets within the real estate segment. Net interest expense was $626,000 for the quarter versus $569,000 in the prior-year quarter, with the increase due to incurring additional long-term indebtedness within the real estate segment since last year.
For the second quarter, our net loss attributable to Books-A-Million was $5.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with the net loss of $3 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal ‘15.
Now I’ll provide you with some balance sheet amounts for the quarter, the following figures are compared to balances at the end of the year ended fiscal year 2015. Inventory was $189.8 million compared to $188 million at the end of last year. Account receivables and related party receivables were $3.1 million compared to $3.5 million at the end of the year, the decrease primarily due to timing of customer payments.
Net property, plant and equipment was $81.5 million compared to $84.8 million at the end of last year and that decrease reflects year-to-date depreciation and store closures offset by some new store opening amounts, capital expenditures.
Total debt was $53.6 million compared to $33.6 million at the end of last year and this increase reflects additional real estate debt and lower AP leverage versus year-end. Stockholders equity exclusive of non-controlling interest was $100.2 million compared to $110.9 million at the end of last year and this decrease reflects our year-to-date net loss.
Year-to-date, capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 were $6.5 million versus $13.9 million in the prior year. And the prior year amounts reflect capital expenditures within our real estate segment.
I will now turn the call over to Terry Finley for a general business update.
Terry Finley
Thank you, Todd, and thanks everyone for participating on the call today. Our slight decline in comparable sales versus last year was largely due to the prior year's success with the particularly strong line of teen titles and the media supporting them. The first two months of the period were particularly challenging with last year's success for movie tie-in merchandise related to John Green's the Fault In Our Stars, and Veronica Roth’s Divergent series providing significant headwinds for our core book business that were difficult to fully offset
The last month of the quarter was a very exciting one for booksellers everywhere and the highly anticipated release of Harper Lee’s Go Set A Watchman did not disappoint. As you no doubt heard, the title was a record breaker for sales in the adults’ fiction category and the excitement of its release got great media attention, increased customer traffic and a comparable sales increase for the month of July. Every team member here at BAMM had a part in this success from the merchant to marketing group that created our plan, down to the operations team and the dedicated booksellers in our stores who flawlessly executed it and I couldn't be more proud of their contribution.
In spite of the headwinds that adversely affected our core book business early in the period, we did continue to see comparable store sales growth in several other areas of our business during the quarter including our gift and general merchandise department, our cafes and in our bargain book area and it has been the trend for several quarters. It was our general merchandise department that delivered the most material year-over-year comparable sales increases.
Within the general merchandise area, we continue to see strong results from our expanded offering at gifts and book related accessories. While all gift categories delivered favorable comparison, the positive performance for last year was driven most materially by toys, games and puzzles, novelty gifts and the book accessories category.
Merchandise aligned with a wide range of media and pop culture related licenses remained strong and continued to drive sales across multiple gift categories. Increases in the toy category continue to be fueled by the sales of adult collector merchandise including Funko’s Pop! figures as well as educational toys and Lego’s new minifigures, Jurassic Park and Minecraft offerings while sales growth in the games and puzzle category was driven primarily by adults’ strategy games and metal marble process and Lego Brickstructures merchandise.
The novelty gift and book accessory category saw nice growth from our proprietary quotable and notable line of literary themed gift, [indiscernible] books and book accessories. In our core book business in spite of those early challenges from the media environment that was not quite as book friendly this year, our overall book sales improved over the prior quarter's performance and we saw several of our larger book categories deliver solid growth during the period. As you might expect, the adult fiction category was particularly strong, obviously driven by the success of Harper Lee’s Go Set A Watchman, but several other titles contributed to the increase, including Grey, E.L. James’ latest installment in the Fifty Shades of Grey series, Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins and Andy Weir’s The Martian.
And a new emerging trend around adult coloring books drove large increases in the art and new age categories. Additionally, a strong performance by several titles including David McCullough’s The Wright Brothers and multiple titles from YouTube personalities like Joey Graceffa, Shane Dawson and Connor Franta generated nice year-over-year growth in the biography category. And as has been the trend for over a year, we continue to see significant growth from the graphic novel category driven predominantly by sales of Manga.
We also continue to see nice growth from our kids book department and while nearly every subcategory in our kids area compared favorably, the release of the never before published Dr. Seuss’ title, What Pet Should I Get, bought an additional excitement to the beginning readers section.
As we move ahead in to the third quarter, we are focused on fine tuning our assortments and merchandise presentations for the all-important holiday selling. The publishing lineup is solid with an abundance of great new commercial fiction from the likes of John Grisham, Sue Grafton, Lee Child and many more and I am sure Bill O'Reilly’s September non-fiction release Killing Reagan will have a long run at the top of our best seller list.
While the early media lineup is not quite as broad as last year, we see several book related movie and television adaptations that should continue to drive additional sales activity and we’re looking forward to an exceptional movie event late in the year that already has zike [ph] guys buzzing in anticipation of the release of Star Wars Episode 7.
We will continue to execute additional sales initiatives within our stores to further support the growth of our book and non-book businesses and will continue to look for opportunities to grow our real estate investments while managing controllable costs and continuing to search for new efficiencies.
And as always, we look forward to serving our customers in the months ahead. Now, we’ll be happy to take any questions you might have.

Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to the Veeva Systems Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Rick Lund, Veeva’s Investor Relations Director. You may begin your conference.
Rick Lund
Thanks Mike. Good afternoon and welcome to Veeva’s fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings call for the quarter ending July 31, 2015. With me on today’s call are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Matt Wallach, our President; and Tim Cabral, our Chief Financial Officer.
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on management’s current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially.
Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q, which is available on the Company’s website at www.veeva.com, under the Investors section and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, August 27, 2015. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today’s call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter, unless we do so in a public form.
On the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today’s earnings release, which is available on our website, and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC just before this call.
With that, thank you for joining us and I will turn it over to Peter.
Peter Gassner
Thank you, Rick. I’m pleased to report that Veeva delivered another quarter of strong growth and profitability with results above our guidance. Revenue in the quarter was $98 million up 30% from last year and subscription revenue totaled $75 million, a 33% year-over-year increase. We posted a non-GAAP operating margin of 29%.
Our outlook for the second half and full fiscal year calls for the continued high growth and profitability that differentiates Veeva within the broader cloud software market. We have further extended our position as a leading cloud solutions provider to the global life sciences industry. This is a $1.6 trillion industry that spends heavily on technology and data and that investment is increasing as life sciences companies look to technology and better data to be more efficient and gain a competitive advantage.
We believe that our proven track record of customer success, continued innovation and execution of our industry cloud strategy positions us well to win a large share of the markets we address over time. The ecosystem around Veeva is also building as we are emerging as the de facto standard in a number of our markets. Key providers are forging alliances with us or extending their existing partnerships. Today we have nearly 50 technology and implementation partners and more than 900 Veeva trained consultants.
In addition, our agency partner program has grown to well over 300 creative agencies worldwide trained on Veeva. This larger community built around Veeva is important as it provides additional reach and many of these partners are viewed as key opinion leaders by the industry.
We’ve deepened our long-standing partnerships with the broad-based players like Accenture and Deloitte. Our relationships with the specialty providers that are solely focused on life sciences are also growing. For instance in the quarter we expanded our relationship with HighPoint, a well respected life sciences focused IT consultancy with a long and successful track record of implementing Master Data Management systems.
HighPoint sees great opportunity in helping us to bring Veeva network to their customers since it is the only Master Data Management application developed exclusively for life sciences. We are already seeing this collaboration payoff in an opportunity with the top 20 Pharma, which progressed this past quarter due in part to this alliance.
Additionally, we recently formed a strategic partnership with ZS Associates. As a 30-year advisor to the industry ZS is a major force in life sciences on the commercial side with over 3,000 employees worldwide. They have worked with more than 200 life sciences companies in 70 countries on their customer facing strategies. ZS’s Chairman delivered a keynote address at our Commercial Summit and shared how we will be working together to accelerate the industries move to multi-channel CRM and provide a new approach to the data market with Veeva OpenData.
The Veeva Commercial Summit in June was our largest to date. Drawing more than 1,000 people, it’s the biggest commercial event in the life sciences industry. To put it in context the life sciences analysts from one of the leading firms told us everyone who is anyone in the industry is at this event and if they aren’t, they’re falling behind. 
Commercial Summit is one of the most important events of the year for Veeva and often sets a stage for many go forward opportunities as hundreds of customers formally and informally share their successes. At Summit, we announced the general availability of Veeva CRM Events Management and Veeva Align as well as the new capability in core CRM that leverages data science to recommend the next best actions in channels to field reps.
It was the 2014 Commercial Summit where we unveiled Commercial Cloud. Our full suite that includes customer data, customer master software, content management and multi-channel CRM. Having data, content and customer interactions altogether is incredibly powerful and can have tremendous impact. It was very positive to see just a year later the number of customers who are planning for the full Commercial Cloud.
For example, one of our newer customers, the top 20 Pharma companies that just started on the path to standardize on our core CRM product is now adding several new solutions within Commercial Cloud. They recognized that an integrated approach is crucial to their commercial success. We are also seeing uptake in small and medium size businesses many of whom before Commercial Cloud that never had access to such a broad and complete suite. They see Commercial Cloud as critical to rapid commercialization and a means to gain competitive advantage.
With Veeva in just a few months they are ready with the commercial infrastructure needed to go-to-market. More than a dozen customers now have at least one solution from each of the four major product families that comprised Commercial Cloud. Within Commercial Cloud our multi-channel CRM product suite continues to rapid a solid pace and we remain on track to achieve an increase in CRM subscription revenue of roughly 20% for the year.
Additional core sales force automation feeds both within our existing customer base and new wins is a growth engine we expect to continue for the coming years and our expanding share in core sales force automation provides the foundation for the up-sell add-on product in the entering to entirely new areas. We believe the overall market for CRM add-on product is significant over the long-term and the majority of the multi-channel CRM market opportunity is still ahead of us.
As of Q2 more than 50 of our CRM customers have started to move toward multi-channel CRM and are beginning with approved email as a way to more effectively reach healthcare providers. Approved email was our second CRM add-on after Veeva CLM and I am pleased to report we are seeing strong adoption. Two of the top 20 Pharmas have standardized their largest U.S. sales teams on approved email.
Subscription revenue for this add-on has nearly tripled year-over-year and we now have our first customer approaching seven figures in annual contract value. Approved email continues to trend we began with Veeva CLM of bringing to market high-value add-ons which in turn drive high attach rates. Like CLM we believe approved email will ultimately be utilized by the majority of our CRM users.
In Q2 we also announced the general availability of Veeva CRM Events Management and Veeva Align which brings us the five substantial add-on products that will enable Veeva to deliver greater value to customers over time. Events Management and Align are showing promising early traction with initial deals for each already signed and pipeline this is strong as we saw with approved email out of the gate.
By moving these functions to Veeva customers can eliminate many disparate and siloed solutions and through the tight integration with core CRM customers gain considerable agility, streamline key business processes and improve compliance. It has become clear that our broad industry cloud vision is winning in the life sciences industry. The second major opportunity for Veeva in industry cloud is Vault.
While it’s early Veeva Vault is on a path to becoming the standard for enterprise content management and life sciences. Regulatory pressures and aging systems are prompting customers to make a change and Veeva has brought to market a suite of industry applications built on our cloud content management platform that is by far best-in-class.
As a result 30 of the top 50 Pharmas have begun using Vault in some capacity. We have 170 Vault customers in total and all have a very long runway remaining for additional Vault growth. As we get further along with customers and better understand the extent to which they want to utilize Vault we have become increasingly bullish on the size of the Vault opportunity ahead of us.
At our current annualized run rate of 75 million for the Vault business we are approaching just 4% penetration within the $2 billion addressable market. We are just at the very early innings here. Today five deep applications and a robust cloud content management platform make up our Vault offerings. The Vault applications stand clinical, quality, regulatory, medical and marketing and we have two more on the horizon for early next year as part of the Veeva RIM suite for regulatory information management.
As with CRM customers often adopt a single Vault solution in the division or geography to start then expand to additional divisions, geographies and functional areas after the initial project success. While no single large Pharma has completely standardized on Vault for enterprise content management yet some are already on that path.
For example we have a top 20 Pharma customers in the early implementation phase with four of the five Vault applications and they are considering a fit. The rapid trajectory of Vault its powerful business benefits and our ability to scale with customers after their initial purchase all combined to provide us with even greater confidence that the Vault opportunity is at least as large as our CRM opportunity and the Vault solution set continues to grow.
The content management landscape in life sciences is predominantly one of legacy client server and homegrown systems as well as paper and manual processes. We are now moving this to the cloud with a set of integrated best-in-class solutions.
In the second quarter, we signed a major Vault eTMF win, our sixth top 20 Pharma customer to choose Vault eTMF within the last 18 months. Vault eTMF will be an enterprise wide standard replacing their entire legacy Documentum Stacks including the core Documentum platform the applications built on top of it as well as – as its infrastructure and services all will be replaced with Veeva Vault in the cloud.
Another of our key customers was so pleased with its initial Vault QualityDocs implementation, which was live and successful in just 12 weeks. That in Q2 they expanded their use of Vault QualityDocs across multiple areas of their manufacturing organization and their outsourced partners, the limitations of their legacy enterprise content management system made it difficult to access and use load them down and put them at some regulatory risk.
With Veeva QualityDocs they’ve streamlined their quality processes strengthen compliance and users can now easily and find and access documents. On the heels of this success we have the opportunity to further grow the Vault footprint at this customer. Overall the pipeline for Vault has never been stronger and we're looking forward to the upcoming Veeva R&D Summit in November where we’ll showcase the breadth of our offerings and give customers and prospects a chance to learn from each other’s successes in moving their content to the cloud with Veeva.
We anticipate far greater numbers this year and representation from decision-makers across R&D. The record attendance we see at Veeva Summits are an indication of our customer success and the industries need to migrate from legacy systems to the cloud it also reflects an industry-wide recognition of the rapid innovation of our industry cloud delivers.
Legacy and point solutions are also the norm today in the customer data market. Until Veeva network the only choices for Master Data Management software were generic toolkits now with Veeva network customers can have a customer master application that’s built specifically for life sciences. For the customer data itself depending upon the regions, companies have had to either piece together customer information from multiple sources or contend with the restrictive legacy provider.
Customer data that is open easy to use and increasingly global is the new imperative for the industry. In Veeva's OpenData and Veeva OpenData’s new approach to customer data eliminates the complicated and prohibitive practices that have held the industry back. In Q2 we launched Veeva OpenData in two additional European markets France and Italy. Bringing our global coverage to six countries even though it's just become available we already have our first customer for data in both France and Italy.
This fall is an early trend we are seeing of customer interest large and small for OpenData just as soon as it's available. Many are interested in data from us regionally or globally as a better option than their historical country-by-country approach. We are also building the Veeva OpenData ecosystem. We now have signed 20 partners to the Veeva OpenData partner program. We believe we have the right offerings to transform the data landscape and are on the path leadership in this market.
Overall we delivered another great quarter above expectations we continue to invest for the opportunity we see ahead and to set the stage for strong future growth expanding our solutions and the team. To that end I am pleased to note we had a record quarter of organic hiring adding 100 employees in Q2.
Veeva is solving and increasing number of challenges faced by our customers. While, delivering strong top line results and solid margins. We are very well-positioned for future growth as the clear industry cloud leader for life sciences. We have multiple vectors for expansion over the long-term.
Our Vault opportunity is at least as big as CRM and growing at over 100% just as CRM did at this phase in its evolution. Our deeply integrated add-on products for multi-channel CRM are gaining early traction. We have made bold moves to disrupt business as usual in the master data management and customer data areas with network and OpenData.
As the life sciences industry moves to the cloud to improve business performance, Veeva is recognized as the innovation leader and strategic partner of choice. For this reason we believe we are well positioned to drive strong growth over the long-term and capitalize on the very large market opportunity that lies ahead.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Tim.
Timothy Cabral
Thanks Peter. Q2 was another solid quarter on both the top and bottom line. Total revenue was $98.1 million up from $75.7 million one-year ago, a 30% increase. We saw outperformance from both subscription and services revenue those similar to Q1 the upside relative to total revenue guidance was more concentrated in the services line.
Subscription revenue was up 33%, $75.3 million from $56.6 million last year. Each of our major product categories contributed to the strength of our subscription revenue growth. We believe we remain on track to generate subscription revenue growth of about 20% from our multi-channel CRM suite of products and well north of a 100% from our non-CRM products for the full fiscal year. 
Our services business performed well in the quarter contributing revenue of $22.8 million up 20% from $19.1 million year-over-year. These results were driven largely by growth in Vault implementations and accelerated CRM project ramps. Overall, our subscription revenue continues to outpace our services revenue increasing the recurring nature of our total revenue.
For the quarter, the percentage mix was 77%, 23% subscription versus services, a two-point shift to subscription year-over-year. The geographic mix of revenue remains relatively stable at 55% from North America and 45% from outside North America based upon the estimated location of users.
In discussing the remainder of the income statement please note that unless otherwise stated all references to our expenses and operating results on a non-GAAP basis and are reconciled to our GAAP results in the tables from our press release, which is posted on our website and filed with the SEC.
In Q2, our subscription gross margin was almost 79% an increase of approximately a 130 basis points from a year ago. This was driven by the continued growth of Vault, Network and CRM add-ons, which have a slightly higher gross margin profile relative to our core SFA product.
Services gross margin for Q2 climbed to more than 31% up from approximately 26% one-year ago. Note that this metric benefited from a large milestone completion that was recognized in Q2, while nearly all the associated costs were incurred in previous periods otherwise services gross margin would have been in the 20s, which is the typical range associated with normal utilization rates of our services teams.
Our total gross margin for Q2 was almost 68% an increase of over 3 percentage points from one-year ago. This improvement was driven by the increased mix of subscription revenue, the continued rise in subscription gross margin and the spike in services gross margin.
Moving down to P&L, operating expenses grew 35% from the same period last year. We had a great quarter attracting talent into our organization resulting in an ending headcount of 1,123. This was up 101 from the end of the prior quarter and represented an increase of 38% on a year-over-year basis. This was a record hiring quarter for Veeva and the additions were focused in three areas that drove long-term growth.
R&D, as we continue to drive innovation in the life sciences industry. Sales and marketing as we continue to expand our resources to bring our growing product suite to the global market and services to ensure that our customers are successful with our solutions. 
Overall, our operating margin of 29% in the second quarter was up 170 basis points from the prior year period driven by an improving gross margin and slightly offset by continued targeted investment to support our long-term growth initiatives. Net income for the quarter was $18.2 million compared to $12.4 million last year.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35.6% is roughly inline with last quarter, but it’s the lower end of the range that we expect going forward. Our fully diluted net income per share was $0.13 compared to $0.09 from the same quarter last year. Before turning to the balance sheet I'd like to touch on FX.
As we’ve discussed on previous calls we typically bill about 80% in U.S. dollars, 10% in euros and the rest in other currencies. Consistent with our expectation shared on last quarter's call, our Q2 revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $2.4 million or 2% due to changes in FX from the same period last year. Assuming current rates remain static we expect the headwind to be roughly $2 million on revenue in Q3 and roughly $7 million to $8 million for all of FY 2016 and increase of $1 million from our previous expectation.
Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue was $110 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $111 million at the end of the first quarter. This resulted in total calculated billings of $96 million which was up 12% year-over-year and above the minimum 5% growth that we discussed on last quarter's call.
Looking ahead to Q3 we expect the year-over-year billings growth and roughly the same range as Q2 about 12%. We recently had a large customer elect to realign the renewal date of a large order from Q3 for the rest of their business which renews in Q1. This means that we will build them for a five-month coterminous sub order in Q3 followed by the full 12 months renewal in Q1 of next year.
As discussed on our last earnings call this type of change has no impact on the timing of revenue recognition or the size of our ongoing customer commitment. However, this particular realignment of renewal date will impact our calculated billings by about $6 million for the third quarter and for the full-year.
Thus for the full-year we now expect our calculated billings to grow roughly 13% compared to our previously shared expectation of approximately 15% with the vast majority of the delta being attributable to the realignment of renewal date for the customer I mentioned earlier.
It’s equally important to note that there is no change to our view that normalized billings growth will be approximately 30% for the full-year. This is another good illustration of why calculated billings is not necessarily an accurate indicator of the growth of our business in any given period and is not a metric that we use internally to evaluate the business.
Moving back to the balance sheet we exited Q2 with $438 million in cash and short-term investments up from $429 million at the end of Q1. This increase was due to a combination of solid cash from operations partially offset by CapEx related to our new headquarters building.
Cash from operations came in at $15.2 million slightly down from $16.6 million one-year ago. This was driven by a tough billings compare and a large cash tax payment due to a smaller stock option exercise deduction to offset year-to-date taxable income. As we said previously our operating cash flows can be volatile quarter-to-quarter so our cash flow performance is best evaluated on the last 12-month basis.
Over the last 12 months, our cash flow from operations was $89.8 million up 60% from the previous 12 months period. Elsewhere on the cash flow statement you'll notice that our total CapEx was $9.8 million. The vast majority of that was related to the continued build-out of our new headquarters building.
We are now moved into the new facility and the build-out is substantially complete. However, because of the timing of completion we now expect $45 million of CapEx related to this project in Q3 beginning in Q4 our CapEx should return to a more normal run rate going forward.
Turning to guidance for the third quarter we expect revenue between $101.5 million and $103 million. Non-GAAP operating income of $27.5 million to $28.5 million and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.11 to $0.12 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $145 million.
For the year we now expect revenue in the range of $395 million to $398 million up from $393 million to $397 million and including the negative FX impact that I noted earlier. We continue to expect subscription revenue to grow in excess of 30% for the full-year. For fiscal 2016 we now anticipate non-GAAP operating income of $111 million to $113 million up from $107 million to $111 million while sustaining investments key to our growth.
Finally, we expect non-GAAP net income per share of $0.47 to $0.48 up from $0.45 to $0.46 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $145 million. Overall I'm very pleased with our Q2 financial results and remain excited about the company’s long-term growth opportunity.
Veeva the innovation leader and driving meaningful customer success in life sciences software industry, we believe the combination of our strong market position and industry cloud model will allow us to deliver a unique combination of long-term growth coupled with strong profits and cash flow in the coming years.
Thank you for joining us today. And I'll turn it back to the operator for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty
Thanks, hi guys. I want to kick off in terms of the billings growth and the realignment I know it's frustrating for you guys, but you know since it is a metric that’s widely used, is there a sense in terms of where we are within the customer base in terms of the impact of this? And other words are we passed the peak of it? Is this something that we could continue to see via persistent headwind on the billings growth reported numbers in the next fiscal year or like I said is the bulk of this behind us?
Timothy Cabral
Hey, Sterling this is Tim thanks for the question. I don't know about characterize the bulk of it being behind us I think what you're seeing and we’ve talked about it both in last quarter and this quarter, what we’re seeing is some of our larger customers who are aligning their billings with us with more of their fiscal year.
I wouldn't say that has been widespread across our customer base nor has it been something that we've heard from all of our customers either. So you know I couldn't characterize it is sort of behind us we’re well through it or that there's a lot in the future either. So I think that's just a little more color for you.
Sterling Auty
And just a follow-up to that. Are these in each of these situations, is this the customer coming back to you guys saying, hey listen we really want to realign it. How does this discussion, how does that even kind of top up that this is a move that they want to make?
Timothy Cabral
It can come from a number of different places Sterling in terms of that conversation what we've seen some pattern for a couple of these customers has been that alignment with their particular fiscal year. So there is no real significant single pattern but again this is not happening across many customers it is just a few customers that happen to be fairly sizable in terms of their run rate with us.
Sterling Auty
All right great. Thank you guys, I appreciate it.
Operator
The next question is from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.
Alpair Tukin
Hey guys this is Alpair Tukin in for Bhavan Suri can you hear me okay.
Peter Gassner
Yes, we can.
Alpair Tukin
Congrats on the quarter. I just had a question around the data opportunity you know I understand you guys have a very large install base today and you guys have really expanded your data play with Veeva Network, OpenData and some recent data related acquisition. And I was just wondering how we should think about this data opportunity and how it's going to play out over the next few years?
Matthew Wallach
Hi, Al, this is Matt. So high-level we see the data opportunity together with the master data management software is about half the size of the CRM opportunity. So we think of it is about a $1 billion opportunity. The data that we go after today is something that goes that the reference data that we call OpenData now is something that goes along with our CRM product or a competitor CRM product basically all the time everywhere in the world.
If you’re going run a Pharma CRM product you need to understand who the physicians are and other healthcare providers and all of the places in which they practice and so this is something that you know in a perfect world this is a 100% attach rate because our customers need to buy both the CRM software and data hopefully both from the same provider.
So we see it is about a $1 billion opportunity we’re very, very early we have data in six countries we have dozens of countries to go. But their early signs are very positive that this is what customers are asking for not just because of the complexity of buying things from multiple providers and some of the restrictions that can lead to, but because there hasn't really been a very innovative approach to creating this data and delivering it right in the hands of the sales reps when and where they need it.
And so there's been a lot of opportunity for innovation we think that we’re filling that space and we think it's a very significant opportunity for us going forward. Now I just finish with the KOLs data coming from the acquisition that we closed last quarter that is starting to come together that also looks like a big opportunity. And they’ll be more along those lines to come in the coming quarters as we start to really commercialize that around the world.
Alpair Tukin
Okay, thanks guys. That was the only question from me.
Operator
The next question is from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley.
Stan Zlotsky
Hi guys, thank you for taking my question. Just a couple of quick questions for you – so Q2 very nice billings. As we think about the rest of the year you reiterated approximate 30% growth in billings for the rest of the year. Are you incrementally more confident in the 30% number and is it also correct that you maybe a little more comfortable in that number coming in above 30% also? And then I have a quick follow-up after that.
Timothy Cabral
Sure. Stan, this is Tim. To be clear what we talked about was the full-year actual billings number we think is going to be about 13%, but when you take out some of the factors that we talked about in the last quarter's call and the recent factor we talked about in my prepared remarks in this call, we still are very confident the normalized calculated billings number is roughly 30%. I don’t know if I would characterize us being more bullish now than we were last quarter I think we are as confident.
Stan Zlotsky
Okay, great. And then a more general question, as you think about the growth of your company are there certain factors that are constraining your growth whether it would be more products being brought to market whether it would be hiring more sales reps or maybe some kind of external factors. That’s it from me. Thank you.
Peter Gassner
Yes, this Peter. We’re really pretty pleased with our growth and our results this quarter growing subscription revenue growth for this quarter 33% forecasting over 30% subscription revenue growth for the year. So we’re really pleased with that. But if you look at the big picture and about our growth and how it comes, we’re building this franchise in our industry cloud for life sciences.
And you can see that in few areas, our core CRM business, it’s strong, we have happy customers and so then we’re able to sell add-on products in there and we’re growing that CRM business at about 20% this year and we have a long way to go in CRM and the add-on products.
And then we talked about Vault and that’s a tremendous opportunity that’s a $2 billion opportunity there, we have a $75 million business, it’s growing at a 100% and we’re really well-positioned for that opportunity. We’re really the clear leader there with nobody else close and there's no question those customers will move from client server to the cloud so that’s really working out in our favor.
And then we have these early things – these early seeds that we’ve planted in Network and OpenData both combined that’s a $1 billion market we've invested over the last couple of years and we’re starting to see early traction. So yes, I'm optimistic. We have the right products, good pipeline of products, we have enthusiastic customers.
And then to get your question about hiring et cetera, yes, we’re able to hire the right volume of great people to fuel our growth, record hiring quarter this quarter and that's probably the thing that makes me the most optimistic. We’re hiring great people; they’re going to do great things so I think our future looks pretty bright.
Stan Zlotsky
Okay, thanks guys.
Operator
The next question is from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brendan Barnicle
Thanks so much. Tim I just wanted to follow-up on Sterling's question about these deals that are – the billing date is changing on we haven't seen that with other SaaS vendors even on big deal, so is there something about life sciences industry where customers are more cash sensitive where they do this kind of shifting around which you haven’t seen it before?
Timothy Cabral
Yes, Brendan I wouldn't say that it’s specific to life sciences and you know these players as well as I do. I don't think cash is an issue for – that the largest of those customers in this industry. I don't know what’s specific about this industry that's driving it. I would say that there is a concentration as we talked about in the past with 70 plus percent of the revenue opportunity being with the largest customers in this industry and that creates some big deals for us and when there are shifts like this it has an impact as we've articulated in the billings number and sort of the billings guidance we've given.
So I wouldn't say it's an indication of a weakness in the market that we serve for sure this is a $1.6 trillion industry and its growing and as you heard Peter talk about it continues to drive and need industry cloud solution to continue to drive its business. So I wouldn't say there's anything specific that I can mention. Matt, do you have any – I’m going to turn it over to you, but do you have any follow-up questions that you’ve been in this industry longer than I have.
Matthew Wallach
Yes, I mean I can think of something that I think is potentially different and that is the high number of acquisitions that we've seen in this industry. I mean we get asked all the time how that affects our company from a revenue and from a customer acquisition perspective it's been pretty neutral, but from this billings perspective I was just working with a customer who was acquired three other Veeva customers they use three different Veeva products and they had eight different renewal dates.
So they're basically getting an invoice from Veeva almost every month. So this company after all these acquisitions and hold on this is a big number, I want to be able to manage it better, let's choose one-day, let's have that be our renewal date and let’s signs sub orders for everything to get us there. That has huge implications on the billings number, but it's all positive for our business it’s the company wanted to make it easier to do business with Veeva.
So I mean that's one thing that stuck out to me and I mean I work pretty closely with that customer to do it and of course that's basically neutral to us. We're doing them a favor, but it's one that we are happy to do as a partner of this industry.
Brendan Barnicle
Great.
Peter Gassner
And Brendan just quickly – hey Brendan I’m sorry just quickly add to match point was a very good one that is just a timing of the billings it is not reducing billings and it doesn’t as we’ve talked about have any impact to the revenue or recognizing or the size and quality of that customer commitment.
Brendan Barnicle
Right, right understood. And then Matt to follow-up around total addressable market as you guys have been adding or introducing some of these new products is $5 million still the right TAM for us to think about or if we seen any increase from some of these new additions?
Matthew Wallach
So there are some small increases, but we haven't gone back and recast the entire TAM. I think what you'll see is some continued announcements from us both in the data space and around content management with Vault that I think at some point we will probably recast, but we will give you a sense of the relative sizes of these new things, but I think it's still right to think of the opportunity we are going after is five or little bit more.
Brendan Barnicle
And then lastly Matt, as you go-to-market on the networking product internationally is that requiring some changes in go-to-market strategy or sales hires?
Matthew Wallach
No I wouldn’t say it requires changes the model that we see where software people can sell software and data people can sell data. That's sort of largely true inside and outside of the U.S. and so as we've expanded we add data specialist people that know how to talk about data, sell data and they work very closely with our software, our existing software team. So nothing really unusual there, it feels a lot like itself when we started to scale up that team in the U.S.
Brendan Barnicle
Great. Thanks guys.

The next question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel.
Tom Roderick
Hey gentlemen good afternoon. I wanted to just kind of shift the discussion here back to the CRM side an I guess one of the things that jumped to me this quarter was the fairly dramatic improvement or increase on the approved email on line. So it’s really nice to see some – we are going to real steep uptake and attraction of that product. The question behind that is as we've seen sort of a natural slowing or deceleration to the CRM business and now you have CLM and approved email as the second product contributing into new products out.
At what point and maybe secular growth level how do we think about where CRM sort of bounces out from a two-year, three-year growth perspective? Is this a product that can still grow even with penetration in the space be and sort of what it is, can it still grows sort of mid-teens if you look out two years, three years is slower than that and what are the drivers and inputs and how you think about that?
Peter Gassner
Matthew you want to take that one?
Matthew Wallach
Yes, Peter I’ll take it. So without providing specific guidance about beyond this year. We think that there's still plenty of room to grow here in both the base CRM and the add-ons. Let me give a little bit color of where the growth is coming from now and how I think it will change. So this year's growth – this fiscal year is even with this great success of approved email the vast majority of growth is still new [CDATs].
So its the base product may be coming along with CLM and approved email but the vast majority of CRM growth this year is new seats. I think that will continue next year, but coming into this year we were selling two add-ons going into next year we’ll have five. And Events and Align are significant opportunities for us engage all three of them they are very early but at some point next year they’re going to start to really drive some revenue as well.
So I think the shift in growth in CRM shifts a little bit towards the add-ons next year, but I think that it still the majority is new CDATs next year. So between the ability to continue to commercialize these five add-on products and even the ability to commercialize new ones over time we still see a long runway of growth in the CRM market.
Tom Roderick
Great. Tim let me shift to next question and ask you a little bit about margins you guys have easily outpaced your expectations for the first half of the year. And yet I also heard you say you hired a record number of people this quarter. So is that shift - is that's sort of signaling renewed effort or newer efforts perhaps on very small products and network products that is a sort of sustained higher level of investment that we should expect for the coming quarters was the 100 plus people sort of a bit more of a catch up. How do we think about the pace of investment in particular how you staff for that?
Peter Gassner
I guess I will pick that one, this is Peter. Yes, I don't think the quarter was any type of anomaly I think we are stepping up our investment and that’s really across all areas because the business is growing across R&D sales marketing and services. We’re making new products we’re improving existing products that drives the growth in R&D. Therefore, we have more products we need more people to sell those products we have more customer relationships to manage in that you know that drives investment sales and services.
So I think its best I could talk about a couple of examples. We’re investing in new applications in the regulatory area the Vault regulatory area with our RIM product, these are brand-new products, brand-new product team, we got to increase the team. We need specialist to bring those markets et cetera so we have to invest there. If you look at investment we’re making in OpenData that's a big investment around the globe we have data in six countries now but you know soon we’ll have many more.
So that takes investment and we tend to really focus our investments I don't - I think its going to continue at this good price. We tend to focus them. Also we – we don't tend to waste money you know we invest the right amount we move fast to get results and one example I can give is about OpenData in Europe, our very first-person for OpenData in Europe we hired them 15 months ago.
Today, we’re selling data in three countries in Europe and we’ll have the whole of Western Europe covered by the end of this year we already have early customers et cetera. So we move pretty quickly and yes we’re in investment mode now as a company we have good opportunities ahead.
Tom Roderick
That’s great. Perfect thank you guys I appreciate it.

The next question is from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Jobin Mathew
Hey guys. This is Jobin Mathew sitting in for Karl. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on the Vault business clearly that's been kind of the foundation for all the growth that you are seeing, so when you said the annualized revenue run rate of $75 million what's the mix of software and services over there? And also when I look at the customer count increases, I think on an annualized basis I think you've grown your Vault customers by over 50%. Where are these new customers coming from? Is it the top 50 Pharma or is it more a smaller start ups what’s the mix there? Thanks and I have a follow-up.
Peter Gassner
Okay Jobin. Good question. Let me start with the big picture and then I’ll dive down into the details of that $75 million. The big picture if you look at what happens, in the content management space it’s very similar to CRM customers or they’re stuck on client server, they need to move to the cloud because they have these slow systems that are difficult to maintain inflexible can be externalized. So they have to move things to the cloud that what’s going on in content management we’re well-positioned because we have the products there in the successful early customers.
Now color on the $75 million I guess and the 100% growth rate I think as you'd expect most of that revenue is subscription revenue. But what's more interesting is most of that revenue is actually on the R&D side of Pharma. And that’s incredibly fast progress in R&D area, which of course is the bigger area, the much bigger area of content management in life sciences. To give you some context it was just two years ago that we sold our first $100,000 deal in R&D so it’s growing very fast and thanks to Vault. Now we are a provider, the only provider that can provide things across R&D and commercial.
Now in terms of the top 50 where does this revenue come from I don't have the exact breakdown there, but it comes in different manners, sometimes with a small biotech, 100 people, 50 people, we will be the first application basically. Hey, let's move all of our important documents off paper because we need to get organized and compliant, we need to be ready for any potential partners, shifts or acquisition.
So that happens and then all the important stuff involved where you have the other type of thing with a very large company, a top 20 type Pharma or Biotech. I was just at one last week where they started very small, very specific process in the quality management area of their company, now they're very happy with it and I had a meeting there and it was all about how can we expand, how can we expand in the different areas of quality, how about regulatory, how about clinical et cetera. So it's really a mix of the large companies and the small and it's actually majority of it is in R&D side of Pharma rather than the commercial.
Jobin Mathew
Got it. And what’s the mix of software and services in the total size of the Vault business today?
Peter Gassner
We are not breaking that down giving exact breakdowns to that level, but as you'd expect it's mostly subscription.
Jobin Mathew
Okay, got it. And then I have a follow-up question. I just wanted to come back to this billings issue. So this isn’t something new that we’re seeing now, obviously we saw it with Workday last night when they said that they were giving some form of new terms of payments to their customers. I'm just trying to understand what's causing this so can I ask in terms of the Pharma customers, at what stage are they in terms if they move to SaaS based solutions? Is there still some pressure on CapEx versus OpEx? And is some of that pressure flowing over to the OpEx side as well which is causing people to push out some of their payments. I'm just curious on any thoughts there. Thanks.
Matthew Wallach
Hi Jobin, this is Matt. Yes, so for sure there is this normal cloud computing shift from capital expenditures to operating expenditures. I think that this industry is generally still a little bit behind from most other industries. For the majority of our customers the first cloud projects they did was Veeva CRM. For a lot of our small R&D customers the first cloud projects they ever did were Veeva Vault. And so it does take some time to mature and to figure out how budgets change.
And so that's why we’re not done with this. I think it’s important to even reiterate. That’s something that we create, we’re flexible, but as the number of products that they buy from Veeva grows as the amount of money that they’re paying to Veeva each year grows, it becomes more and more important for them to line it up with their – sometimes very lengthy budget cycles and it just becomes easier to manage.
Jobin Mathew
Okay, thanks.

The next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
Patrick Falzon
Hi, this is actually Patrick Falzon on for Kirk. Congrats on the quarter. As it relates to the big name Vault [wins] are these net new customers for you guys or you up selling into existing CRM customers in those instances and I guess more generally what kind of traction are you seeing with Vault and net new customer accounts?
Peter Gassner
We see traction in both ways certainly with existing customers and really if you look at maybe the top hundred Pharma, Biotech’s most of them are our customers. Now in some Pharma or another so pretty soon we’re going to collect all the logos. But we really have a mix of both the largest number of net new customers of course are in the small and emerging biotech right there is many hundreds of them and so we’re collecting new logos all the time there.
We have very low penetration. I guess that's the thing to remember about Vault that – it starts in a particular functional area, division or geography that’s how it starts especially in a large company in one of the top 50 started in area, geography, particular application and then it grows from there. So right now we estimate as we mentioned little less than 4% penetrated so the growth is coming in all areas.
Patrick Falzon
Great. Thanks.
Operator
The next question is from Peter Lowry with JMP securities.
Peter Lowry
Great, thank you. Can you talk about where your customers are pulling you next? What are they asking for and then how do you manage that demand versus executing on the existing product that you already have?
Peter Gassner
This is Peter I’ll take that one. Yes, that’s something I have a lot of experience in over the last 20 years in enterprise software. I once had a mentor of mine say you can go out of business just doing what your customers want and you have to balance that with the market and what they need and you have to have a good vision looking forward.
I can tell you when we started Vault in the first line of code in 2010 there was not a customer asking for right. So the big macro level pictures you’ve to get out, you’ve to leave the deck, you’ve to [indiscernible] where the part is going to be, but then as you calibrate on these macro level best then you can really use your customers to guide you.
So a great example is the large investment we are making in RIM, the regulatory area of Vault, we have Vault out there, we have it in the clinical area, we start seeing this need in the regulatory, we start seeing customers asking for and multiple customers and starting to really understand why they're asking for and does that makes sense and then we sort of pounce on that. We’ll make then okay that's it and we’re all in and we’re in it to win it. So that's kind of how we look at it. Macro level things you got to leave the deck and then incremental things you got to listen to multiple customers and make a decision.
Peter Lowry
Great, thank you.

We have time for one more question. The last question is from Steven Wardell with Leerink Partners.
Steven Wardell
Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Can you tell us about what you're hearing from Veeva Vault prospects in the market recently, what are the issues that they're talking to you about in general and in particular just in general was the first part of that and then particular you mentioned that 30 of the top 50 Pharma have begun using Vault in some capacity that's great news.
My impression is that buyers of Vault kind of have longer decision time frames than buyers of CRM and they have a greater challenge transitioning their software systems to a Vault like product than CRM this greater kind of a transition cost and are you finding something else or you finding that they are able to make decisions faster or that they are able to transition with less challenge, less cost transitioning?
Peter Gassner
Well, I’d say Vault has more variety than CRM in a couple different ways. First of all yes we would sell Vault to the largest Pharma customers just like we do CRM, but you got to remember we're selling to 50 person Biotech involved and those are people who never even need CRM yet. It’s not only that we are selling all the way from all R&D and manufacturing side all the way to commercial so there is more variety.
So I would say some Vault cycles are faster than CRM sales cycle. It’s more about getting their first systems this might literally be a three-week discussion and the way we go. Now if you're talking about the system to store the most important clinical document set up at the largest Pharma company that's probably going to be a longer sales cycle than CRM just because the importance is higher.
So that’s kind of what we are seeing in more variety that common themes are you got to move fast, you got to be externalize, you need a cloud-based system so that's either a small company saying of course I'm going right to the cloud, there's no way I’m installing some software or existing customer has them on premise and they know they have to get rid of it. I think also they like performance, global performance and the notion of this stuff especially in R&D is very global.
Global teams working on it. They like the fact that they can have good performance and also its externalized access and if you look at the manufacturing area, this area outsourced manufacturing is there's serious economic benefits for our customers if they can do that and do that correctly, very clear competitive advantage. And to do that either have to shuffle around a lot of paper or you need an externalized system. So that's also a driver, but I would say at a high-level we’ve comeback there is a lot more variety involved and there is in CRM because of small and large companies and because of the different areas.
Steven Wardell
Great, thank you.
